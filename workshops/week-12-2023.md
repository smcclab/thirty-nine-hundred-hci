author: Dr Jennyfer Lawrence Taylor

## Aims and Purpose

The purpose of this tutorial is for your group to deliver your **Oral
Presentation with Prototype Demonstration** for the Prototype Design and
Presentation Assessment.

## Preparation

You should complete the following activities prior to attending your
tutorial:

1.  Review the specification and marking rubric for the Prototype Design
    and Presentation Assessment in the Course Syllabus.

2.  Review the Week 11 Lecture content addressing the oral presentation.

3.  Review the Wattle Announcement **Week 12 Oral Presentation:
    Important Information** (posted 17 October 2022).

## Activities

Oral presentations with prototype demonstration from each group.

- You will be presenting in the order of your group numbers (i.e., the
  lowest group number will present first, and the highest group number
  will present last). Your presentation will be assessed by two members
  of the teaching team.

- If it is your turn to present, set up your presentation quietly and
  efficiently.

  - For tutorials with only a small number of groups, wait until the
    previous presentation has finished before setting up.

  - For tutorials with a large number of groups (i.e., 4-5), you will
    need to set up during the previous group's Q&A session. Please wait
    until the Q&A has started before setting up so as not to disturb the
    presenting group.

- You will have 8 minutes total to deliver your oral presentation and
  show your prototype, followed by 1-2 minutes of questions.

  - The Tutor(s) running the session will indicate to you when you have
    5 minutes remaining, 2 minutes remaining, and when 'time is up'.

  - When 'time is up', you must stop speaking and transition to Q & A.
    If you have not reached the end of your talk within the allotted
    time, you will need to stop presenting at whichever point you have
    reached in your presentation.

- If it is not your group's turn to present, please be a respectful and
  engaged audience for your peers. There may be time for you to ask a
  question of the presenting group. You are expected to remain until the
  end of the tutorial as a courtesy to other groups who have watched
  your own presentation.

- If there is still time remaining at the end of your tutorial after the
  presentations have concluded, please use this time to work with your
  group to upload your presentation slides, or **individually** complete
  your Group Member Peer Moderation Form Round 2.

**Important Notes**

Please arrive before your scheduled tutorial time to ensure that the
session runs on time. Tutorials must finish on time. If you arrive late,
then you may not have enough time left to give your full presentation.

If you are attending an online tutorial on Zoom, you are expected to
**turn your camera on and keep your camera on for the duration of your
oral presentation.**
