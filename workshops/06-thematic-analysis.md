## Pre-Class Tasks

You must complete these tasks before the start of your tutorial.

1. Read Chapter 9: Interpretation, Data Analysis, and Presentation in [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023]. Available as an e-book through the library.
2. Read this resource: <https://www.nngroup.com/articles/affinity-diagram/>
3. Watch this video: TBA - Need to hunt down the affinity mapping video!
4. Interview a friend or family member and post the transcript on the pre-class forum (interview script to be provided - everyone to conduct the same interview!)

## Plan for the Class

The tutorial will follow this structure:

0. Discuss pre-class tasks
1. Affinity mapping
2. Finding themes
3. Creating findings statements


## In-Class Tasks

### 0. Discuss pre-class tasks (10 minutes)

As a class, or in groups of 4-5, discuss how your interviewing process went. 

- Who did you interview?
- How did the interview process go?
- How did you transcribe the interview or take notes?
- What would you do differently next time?

### 1. Affinity mapping (25 minutes)

In groups:

- Write your interview data onto post-it notes and add each note the wall
- Cluster similar post-its and discuss
- Write a heading for each theme

### 2. Create findings statements (30 minutes)

In your group, turn your themes into findings statements.

For each theme:
- Write a short statement that explains the theme
- Add any further context
- Explain the impact of not actioning the finding (this is the "so what?")

### 3. Report back and discuss your findings (15 minutes)

Your tutor will lead a whole-class discussion about your findings. What are the common themes across groups?

Take a photo of your wall and findings and post on the forum!
