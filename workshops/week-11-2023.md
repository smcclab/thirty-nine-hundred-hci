**Tutorial Week 11, Semester 2 2022: Evaluation**

Prepared by Jennyfer Lawrence Taylor

**Aims and Purpose**

The purpose of this tutorial is to help you to design and conduct an
evaluation activity.

The intended learning outcomes for this tutorial are to:

- Develop design evaluation goals

- Design evaluation activities using qualitative methods

- Facilitate an evaluation activity with technology users

- Critically reflect on which evaluation methods can address particular
  kinds of evaluation goals and research questions

**Preparation**

You should complete the following activities prior to attending your
tutorial:

1.  Review the Week 10 -- Week 11 lecture content on **Evaluation\**

2.  Read the following chapters from *Interaction Design: Beyond
    Human-Computer Interaction* (Sharp et al. 2019):

    - **Chapter 14 Introducing Evaluation** (pp.495-521)

    - **Chapter 15 Evaluation Studies: From Controlled to Natural
      Settings** (pp.523-533, pp.536-545)

3.  Familiarise yourself with the ANU's publicly facing website and its
    features, as you will be evaluating the ANU website in the tutorial
    this week: <https://www.anu.edu.au>. Particular areas of the ANU
    website that you might like to focus on are:

    - **Accommodation portal:**
      <https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation>

    - **Programs and courses:** <https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au>

    - **Academic skills:**
      <https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills>

    - **Campus map:** <https://www.anu.edu.au/maps#>

    - **ANU Library:** <https://anulib.anu.edu.au>

    - **Events calendar:** <https://www.anu.edu.au/events>

    - **Careers site:**
      <https://www.anu.edu.au/students/careers-opportunities/careers>

    - **Jobs portal:** <https://www.anu.edu.au/jobs>

**Structure**

1.  Plan your evaluation activity - individually (10 mins)

2.  Conduct your evaluation activity in pairs (30 mins)

3.  Report back and close (10 mins)

**Activities**

1.  Plan your evaluation activity - individually (10 mins)

    - Choose a particular feature of the ANU website that you wish to
      evaluate, that can facilitate a task for the user to complete
      (e.g., finding ANU accommodation choices that satisfy X criteria).

      - You can choose one of the areas listed above, or another area of
        this website not on the list. Choose an area of the ANU website
        that **does not** require logging in (i.e., a publicly
        accessible part of the website).

    - Choose one user experience AND one usability evaluation goal to
      focus on.

    - Choose a task for the user to complete that would address your
      evaluation goals.

    - Plan a 10-minute think aloud evaluation activity, where you ask
      the user to complete the task and think aloud as they are doing
      it.

      - Write down your instructions to participants as a script.

      - Ensure that you ask participants consent to take part in the
        evaluation task, and thank them for their time at the end.

      - You cannot record the 'participant'. You can only take
        handwritten notes that do not include any identifying
        information in them for the purpose of the tutorial discussion.

2.  Conduct your evaluation activity in pairs (30 mins)

    - Your Tutor will automatically assign you to a break-out room with
      one other person at random.

      - It does not matter if they are not in the same project group as
        you, as this task does not relate to the Prototype Design and
        Presentation Assessment.

      - If there is an uneven number of participants, the Tutor will
        create a group of three.

    - Take turns to conduct and participate in your evaluation activity
      in pairs.

      - If you are in the group of three, you can stay in your breakout
        room for the full 30 minutes rather than returning to the main
        room if you need more time.

    - Discuss what the outcomes of your evaluation activities were, and
      whether they met your evaluation goals. Identify strengths and
      limitations to your evaluation approaches.

3.  Report back and close (10 mins)

    - The Tutor will bring everyone back together to the main Zoom room
      for a discussion, addressing the following questions:

      - What were your evaluation goals? What were the findings from
        your evaluation activity?

      - What did you learn about facilitating evaluation activities? How
        will you improve your skills as a facilitator based on your
        experiences in this tutorial?

      - What were the limitations or constraints to your approach?

      - Would this be a useful evaluation approach to take if you were
        to run an evaluation study of your high-fidelity prototype?
        Why/why not?

    <!-- -->

    - The Tutor will answer questions if there is time and close the
      tutorial session.
