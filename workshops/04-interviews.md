The purpose of this tutorial is to give you hands-on experience with
designing and conducting semi-structured interviews. This is one of the
most common data collection methods in HCI research.

The intended learning outcomes of this tutorial are to:

- Define and identify the features of a semi-structured user interview
- Design an interview guide with well-defined themes and questions
- Evaluate interview questions through practice with other participants
- Reflect on the interview interactions and questions to refine your
  interview approach

## Pre-Class Tasks

You should complete the following activities prior to attending your
tutorial:

1.  Review the **Week 3** lecture content on Interviews

2.  Read **Chapter 8 Data Gathering**, Section 8.4 Interviews (pp.
    268-278) in Sharp et al. 2019 *Interaction Design: Beyond
    Human-Computer Interaction* (Sharp, Preece & Rogers 2019) --
    Available as an e-book through ANU Library website

3.  Read the following paper to see an example of an interview guide
    (accessible through the ACM Digital Library):\
    *Sara Ljungblad, Yemao Man, Mehmet Aydın Baytaş, Mafalda Gamboa,
    Mohammad Obaid, and Morten Fjeld. 2021. What Matters in Professional
    Drone Pilots' Practice? An Interview Study to Understand the
    Complexity of Their Work and Inform Human-Drone Interaction

## Plan for the Class

The tutorial will follow this structure:

1.  Project group formation (10 mins)
2.  Designing an interview guide individually (10 mins)
3.  Conducting an interview in pairs (20 mins)
4.  Reporting back and reflecting, and close (10 mins)

## In-Class Tasks

### Designing an interview guide individually (10 mins)

a.  Your Tutor will ask the following discussion question: How would
    you define a "semi-structured interview" in your own words? Why
    are semi-structured interviews a useful method in HCI research?

b.  You will undertake the following task individually: Design a
    semi-structured interview guide on the topic of "university
    students' experiences of online shopping":

    i.  Give your interview guide a name

    ii. Write an 'icebreaker question' as a conversation starter to
        build rapport

    iii. Write 5 interview questions about this topic

    iv. Include a prompt to thank your participants at the end of
        your interview guide

### Conducting your interview in pairs (20 mins)

a.  Choose another person from the tutorial to work with

b.  Practice asking the person the questions from your interview
    guide

    i.  Try and ask at least one follow-up questions that relates to
        their responses, but was not in your original interview
        guide

c.  Do not record or write down their responses, but note down any
    feedback and suggestions that you have for your interviewer
    about their technique

d.  Give the other person feedback on their interview questions and
    technique

e.  Make sure to swap over the interviewer and interviewee after 10
    minutes

### Reporting back and reflecting, and close (10 mins)

The Tutor will bring you back together for a whole group
discussion to reflect on what you learnt and observed. Think
about the following questions:

1. Why are semi-structured interviews a useful method in HCI research?
2. What was your experience of designing your interview guide? How did you think of ideas for interview questions? Can you share some of your questions with the rest of the class?
3. What did you learn about conducting interviews when working in your pairs? What kinds of feedback did you receive from your interview partner?
4. How might you refine and improve your interview questions based on your experiences and the feedback that you received?
