This week you will gain hands-on experience with designing and conducting semi-structured interviews. This is one of the most common data collection methods in HCI research. Importantly, interviews help us to gather information related to our known research goals as well as information that we don't know to ask about.

<!-- 
- Define and identify the features of a semi-structured user interview
- Design an interview guide with well-defined themes and questions
- Evaluate interview questions through practice with other participants
- Reflect on the interview interactions and questions to refine your
  interview approach -->

## Pre-Class Tasks

You should complete the following activities prior to attending your
tutorial:

1. Read **Chapter 8 Data Gathering** in [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023]. Available as an [ebook through the ANU Library](https://quicklink.anu.edu.au/kv9b).

2. Read this resource: <https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interview-guide/>

3. Post a forum post following the instructions below:

Go back to the interface/object that you discussed in the previous tutorial[^1].

Write five questions about this your interface or object. The questions are aimed at understanding _the experience that someone else had with that interface or object_.

Post your questions on the forum, along with a picture/sketch of the object.

4. Comment on another person's forum post following these instructions:

Find another person's interface/object interview questions on the forum.

Answer one of the interview questions as a comment on their question. Make sure you list the number and question that you are answering.

Design a semi-structured interview guide on the topic of the pre-class task that you submitted last Week (Week 4). Last week you identified bad design features. This week, your goal is to explore the experience that someone else had with that object/interface or a similar one.

[^1]: If you did not complete the task last week or want to change interface/object, that's ok. 

## Plan for the Class

<!-- 3.  Read the following paper to see an example of an interview guide
    (accessible through the ACM Digital Library): 
    [Sara Ljungblad et al. 2021. What Matters in Professional Drone Pilots' Practice? An Interview Study to Understand the Complexity of Their Work and Inform Human-Drone Interaction Research. In Proc. CHI \'21.](https://doi-org.virtual.anu.edu.au/10.1145/3411764.3445737) [@ljungblad-what-matters:2021] -->

<!-- scaffolding the group activities, reflections on the question (open, closed), what is the answer, what is expected/needed, what is the goal? -->
<!-- probing question, leading questions,  -->


<!-- 10 minutes for roll and start up -->
<!-- 5 mins for announcements -->
<!-- maybe first 30 minutes is about critique, categorisation and improvement of the questions from the pre-class tasks -->
<!-- next 45 role-playing -->

The tutorial will follow this structure:

1.  Intro (5 mins)
2.  Review - Interviews (5 mins)
3.  Quiz - Types of interview questions (20 mins)
4.  Designing a semi-structured interview guide individually (15 mins)
5.  Role-playing interviews in pairs (30 mins)
6.  Reporting back and reflecting (10 mins)
7.  What's next (5 mins)

## In-Class Tasks

### Review Types of Interviews (5 mins)

Your Tutor will ask the following discussion questions: 

- "What are the key differences between unstructured, structured and semi-structured interviews?" 
- "What is a focus group?"

### Quiz - Types of interview questions (20 mins)

#### Interview Questions

- "What is the difference between open and closed questions?"
- "What is the difference between leading and neutral questions?"
- "What are probing questions?
- "What makes a good interview question?"
- "How might the type of questions influence the data you collect?"

#### 1: Analysing sample questions

You will work in small groups of 3-5 students. Each group will receive a set of cards containing a mix of interview questions. Analyse each question as follows

- 1st run: Is it a closed question or an open question? Mark the card with a C for closed and an O for open.
- 2nd run: Check for bias. Is it a leading question or is it neutral? Mark the card with an L for leading and N for neutral.
- 3rd run: Identify probing questions -> Mark the card with a P.

### Designing an interview guide individually (15 mins)

You will undertake the following task by yourself:  Design a semi-structured interview guide on the topic of the pre-class task that you submitted last Week (Week 4). Last week you identified bad design features. This week, your goal is to explore the experience that someone else had with that object/interface or a similar one.

1. Give your interview guide a title
2. Briefly introduce the topic.
3. Write an 'icebreaker question' as a conversation starter.
4. Write 4 interview questions about this topic. Include additional follow-up/probing questions.
5. Include a prompt to thank your participants at the end of your interview guide.
    
Consider the following:

- What is the goal of the interview?
- Is the question open or closed?
- Use neutral questions, avoid leading questions.

### Conducting your interview in pairs (20 mins)

1. Choose another person from the tutorial to work with.
2. Practice asking the person the questions from your interview guide. Try and ask at least one follow-up questions that relates to their responses, but was not in your original interview guide
3. Do not record or write down their responses.  
4. Write brief notes of any feedback and suggestions that you have for your interviewer.  
5. Give feedback.  
6. Swap roles after 10 minutes.

### Reporting back and reflecting (10 mins)

The tutor will bring you back together for a whole group discussion to reflect on what you learnt and observed. Think about the following questions:

1. Why are semi-structured interviews a useful method in HCI research?
2. What was your experience of designing your interview guide?
3. What did you learn about conducting interviews when working in your pairs?
4. How might you refine and improve your interview questions based on your experiences and the feedback that you received?
