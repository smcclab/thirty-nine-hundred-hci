title: Interviews
author: Dr Jennyfer Lawrence Taylor

The purpose of this tutorial is to give you hands-on experience with
designing and conducting semi-structured interviews. This is one of the
most common data collection methods in HCI research.

The intended learning outcomes of this tutorial are to:

- Define and identify the features of a semi-structured user interview
- Design an interview guide with well-defined themes and questions
- Evaluate interview questions through practice with other participants
- Reflect on the interview interactions and questions to refine your
  interview approach

## Pre-Class Tasks

You should complete the following activities prior to attending your
tutorial:

1.  Review the lecture content on Data Gathering

2.  Read **Chapter 8 Data Gathering**, Section 8.4 Interviews (pp.
    268-278) in Sharp et al. 2019 *Interaction Design: Beyond
    Human-Computer Interaction* (Sharp, Preece & Rogers 2019) --
    Available as an e-book through ANU Library website

3.  Read the following paper to see an example of an interview guide
    (accessible through the ACM Digital Library):\
    *Sara Ljungblad, Yemao Man, Mehmet Aydın Baytaş, Mafalda Gamboa,
    Mohammad Obaid, and Morten Fjeld. 2021. What Matters in Professional
    Drone Pilots' Practice? An Interview Study to Understand the
    Complexity of Their Work and Inform Human-Drone Interaction
    Research. In Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors

<!-- something like write 5 questions about _something_ -->
<!-- post on the forum, comment on someone elses post (?) what aspect? -->


## Plan for the Class

<!-- scaffolding the group activities, reflections on the question (open, closed), what is the answer, what is expected/needed, what is the goal? -->
<!-- probing question, leading questions,  -->


<!-- 10 minutes for roll and start up -->
<!-- 5 mins for announcements -->
<!-- maybe first 30 minutes is about critique, categorisation and improvement of the questions from the pre-class tasks -->
<!-- next 45 role-playing -->

The tutorial will follow this structure:
1.  Class roll (5 mins)
2.  Review - Interviews (5 mins)
3.  Quizz - Types of interview questions (20 mins)
4.  Designing a semi-structured interview guide individually (15 mins)
5.  Role-playing interviews in pairs (30 mins)
6.  Reporting back and reflecting (10 mins)
7.  What's next (5 mins)

## In-Class Tasks

### Review Types of Interviews (5 mins)
Your Tutor will ask the following discussion questions: 
- "What are the key differences between unstructured, structured and semi-structured interviews?" 
- "What is a focus group?"

### Quizz - Types of interview questions (20 mins)
a. Your Tutor will ask you the following discussion question:
- "What is the difference between open and closed questions?"
- "What is the difference between leading and neutral questions?"
- "What are probing questions?
- "What makes a good interview question?"
- "How might the type of questions influence the data you collect?"

b. Quizz - Types of interview questions  
You will work in small groups of 3-5 students. Each group will receive a set of cards containing a mix of interview questions.
<!--to scaffold cogntive load and structure their analysis process: --> 
Analyse each question as follows
- 1st run: Is it a closed question or an open question? Mark the card with a C for closed and an O for open.
- 2nd run: Check for bias -> Is it a leading question or is it neutral? Mark the card with an L for leading and N for neutral.
- 3rd run: Identify probing questions -> Mark the card with a P.

### Designing an interview guide individually (15 mins)
You will undertake the following task individually:  
Design a semi-structured interview guide on the topic of the pre-class task that you submitted last Week (Week 4). Last week you identified bad design features. This week, your goal is to explore the experience that someone else had with that object/interface or a similar one.

    1. Give your interview guide a title
    2. Briefly introduce the topic.
    3. Write an 'icebreaker question' as a conversation starter.
    4. Write 4 interview questions about this topic. Include additional follow-up/probing questions.
    5. Include a prompt to thank your participants at the end of your interview guide.
    
<!-- a.  Your Tutor will ask the following discussion question: How would
    you define a "semi-structured interview" in your own words? Why
    are semi-structured interviews a useful method in HCI research?

b.  You will undertake the following task individually: Design a
    semi-structured interview guide on the topic of "university
    students' experiences of online shopping":

    i.  Give your interview guide a name

    ii. Write an 'icebreaker question' as a conversation starter to
        build rapport

    iii. Write 5 interview questions about this topic

    iv. Include a prompt to thank your participants at the end of
        your interview guide
-->
### Conducting your interview in pairs (20 mins)

a.  Choose another person from the tutorial to work with

b.  Practice asking the person the questions from your interview
    guide

    i.  Try and ask at least one follow-up questions that relates to
        their responses, but was not in your original interview
        guide

c.  Do not record or write down their responses, but note down any
    feedback and suggestions that you have for your interviewer
    about their technique

d.  Give the other person feedback on their interview questions and
    technique

e.  Make sure to swap over the interviewer and interviewee after 10
    minutes

### Reporting back and reflecting (10 mins)
The Tutor will bring you back together for a whole group discussion to reflect on what you learnt and observed. Think about the following questions:
1. Why are semi-structured interviews a useful method in HCI research?
2. What was your experience of designing your interview guide?
3. What did you learn about conducting interviews when working in your pairs?
4. How might you refine and improve your interview questions based on your experiences and the feedback that you received?

Consider the following:
- What is the goal of the interview?
- llll
<!--
1. Why are semi-structured interviews a useful method in HCI research?
2. What was your experience of designing your interview guide? How did you think of ideas for interview questions? Can you share some of your questions with the rest of the class?
3. What did you learn about conducting interviews when working in your pairs? What kinds of feedback did you receive from your interview partner?
4. How might you refine and improve your interview questions based on your experiences and the feedback that you received?
