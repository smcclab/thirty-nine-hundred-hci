author: Dr Jennyfer Lawrence Taylor
---

## Aims and Purpose

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to the *ANU Responsible
Conduct of Research Policy* and NHMRC *National Statement on Ethical
Conduct in Human Research.* You will learn how to apply these principles
and concepts to qualitative HCI research.

The intended learning outcomes for this tutorial are:

- Define the *NHMRC National Statement* values and principles
- Apply the *NHMRC National Statement* values and principles in the
  conduct of qualitative HCI projects
- Identify ethical issues in HCI research involving people

## Preparation

You should complete the following activities prior to attending your
tutorial:

1.  Review the Week 4 lecture content on Ethics

2.  Read the following documents:

    - *NHMRC National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research*
      from **Preamble, Purpose, Chapter 1, and Chapter 2 (p.3-22)
      (**<https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/national-statement-ethical-conduct-human-research-2007-updated-2018>
      (NHRMC 2018)

## Structure

The tutorial will follow this structure:

1.  Small group discussion of the *NHMRC* *National Statement* values
    and principles with respect to the HCI projects (15 mins)

2.  Small group discussion of benefit, risk, consent, and
    confidentiality with respect to HCI projects (20 mins)

3.  Report back to the tutorial group and close (10 mins)

## Activities

### Group assignments

Your Tutor will divide the class into 4 groups

Each group will be allocated one of the following papers:

- **Project 1 -- Co-Design of a social media platform for Aboriginal
  Australians** (Leong, Lawrence & Wadley 2019)

- **Project 2 -- Designing a smart clothing telehealth system for
  physical rehabilitation of lower limb pain** (Aggarwal et al.
  2020)

- **Project 3 -- Participatory research with children about their
  play activities** (Cumbo, Eriksson & Iversen 2019)

- **Project 4 -- Social uses of social robots among people with
  intellectual disability** (Balasuriya et al. 2019)**\**

### Values and Principles

Small group discussion of the **NHMRC National Statement values and     principles** with respect to the HCI projects (15 mins)

For each of the NHMRC values and principles (research merit and integrity, justice, beneficence, or respect):

a.  Summarise the value or principle in your own words in 1-2
    sentences

b.  Brainstorm how the principle applies to your allocated paper and
    to the HCI research methods discussed in the course more broadly

###  Benefits, risks, consent, and confidentiality

Small group discussion of benefit, risk, consent, confidentiality    with respect to HCI projects (20 mins)

a.  Review the paper (in particular the title, abstract, and methods
    sections) and discuss the benefits, risks, consent, and
    confidentiality mechanisms and issues that would apply in the
    conduct of this research

b.  Refer to the *National Statement* to check whether there are any
    particular considerations that would apply to working with the
    participant groups addressed in these projects

### Report back to and close (10 mins)

a.  Your Tutor will bring you back together for a whole group discussion

b.  Share your thoughts on how these values, principles, and concepts
    apply to the conduct of HCI research with human participants. What
    did you learn that was new/interesting/surprising?

c.  Your Tutor will bring the tutorial to a close and answer any
    questions if time.
