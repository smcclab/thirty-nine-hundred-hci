    PDF is supplementary only- you need to watch the lectures as well as
    reading the slides).\
    \
    Have a go at answering the quiz questions (in real-time or by
    pausing the recording if you are watching asynchronously)

4.  Review the recent Wattle Announcements information posts relating to
    the Project Work

## Structure

The tutorial will follow this structure:

2.  Make progress with your Project 2 Submission (30 minutes) --
    individual
3.  Your Tutor will answer any general questions if there is time
    remaining (5 minutes)

## Activities

### Self-Reflection Activity (15 minutes) -- individual

Please answer the following self-reflection questions and upload
your responses to the Wattle Form link with the Week 6 content.
This task is not assessed.

The Teaching Team will review the responses in order to support
you, and help you stay on the right track for your **Project 2
Assessment.** Your responses will not be shared with other
students.

If you are unsure about how to answer these questions, make sure
that you speak to the Teaching Team during your tutorial time and
ask for help.

Self-Reflection Questions:

- **Making Activity:**

  - What is your chosen making activity? (if you have changed/revised
    this since for Project 2, provide your updated activity)

  - Complete these sentences:

    - My making activity is \<verb-ing\>

    - When I do my making activity, I produce \<plural noun\>

- **Cultural Probe Kit Design:\**
  I have reflected on my cultural probe kit design from Project 1 and
  identified that my submission (choose all that apply):

  - Did not focus on an appropriate making activity

  - Presented a new technology design, when this was not the purpose of
    Project 1

  - Included an incomplete cultural probe kit, that I cannot readily
    complete myself in Project 2

  - Did not include a cultural probe kit

  - Included cultural probe tasks that I cannot feasibly complete myself
    in Project 2

  - Included cultural probe tasks that require the involvement of other
    people to complete, which is not permitted for Project 2

  - Included cultural probe tasks that require the use of tools and
    equipment beyond simple paper and pen crafting materials or digital
    tasks

  - None of these issues are relevant to my Project 1 submission

- **Revising Your Cultural Probe Kit Design (if applicable)**

  - I will revise my cultural probe kit in the following ways to address
    these issues and ensure that I meet the specifications for Project 2
    (if applicable)

  - I understand that I need to include the original and revised
    versions of my cultural probe kit as appendices in my Project 2
    submission

- **Questions:**

  - I have the following questions for the teaching team about the
    Project Assessment

### Make progress with your Project 2 Submission (30 minutes) -- individual

- Work individually towards completing tasks relating to your
  Project 2 submission. Do not collaborate with other students on
  this task.

- Please ask the teaching team if you have any questions about the
  Project 2 activities during the tutorial.
