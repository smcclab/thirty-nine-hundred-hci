This tutorial will help you understand how to design a research project. You will consider how to find real-world problems, how to identify research gaps, and how to write a research question. This work directly relates to the final project. In the pre-lab task you will analyse an existing evaluation study. In the other tasks you will design a new one collaboratively.

## Pre-Class Tasks

<!-- clones the evaluation activity on p546 in the text book, "In-depth Activity" end of chapter 14. -->

### Analyse an evaluation from the HCI literature

Choose an example of a evaluation study from either [CHI](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi/proceedings) or [DIS](https://dl.acm.org/conference/dis/proceedings (use the ACM Digital Library to search for relevant papers, or browse through the proceedings of [these](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi/proceedings) [conferences](https://dl.acm.org/conference/dis/proceedings)). Read through the study and answer the following questions:

1. Name of the study or system/app 
2. When during the design the evaluation occurred
3. How controlled was the study, what role did users have?
4. Which methods were used?
5. What kind of data was collected and how was it analysed.
6. What was learned from the study?
7. Did the evaluation focus on usability goals or user experience goals?
8. Were there any notable issues?

### Post on the forum:

1. An image of the paper's first page or of the system/app analysed.
2. A clear citation to the paper you have analysed (in ACM format)
3. The answers to the above questions
4. Make sure you have studied [the lecture notes from week 8 (evaluation)](https://smcclab.github.io/thirty-nine-hundred-hci/lectures/08-evaluation.html)

## Plan for the Class

You could include a schedule here for what will happen in the class. This will benefit the tutor as they can keep on track. Each required in-class task should have a different point in a numbered list.

1. look at pre-class tasks (20m)
2. Task 1: do something (30m)
3. Task 2: do something else (20m)
4. Task 3: an even more interesting, and yet different, thing (20m)
5. Extra Tasks (if time)
6. Individual consultation time (30m drop-in following tutorial)

## In-Class Tasks

### Task 1: Discuss the evaluation analyses

- In groups or as a class discuss your evaluation analyses.
- Create a table with one question in each column and one paper in each row, summarise the answer in a few words for each question to fit.

Do any trends emerge from the table? What kinds of evaluations seem to be popular?

### Task 2: Research Questions

Research questions have been called [survival beacons](https://lennartnacke.com/how-to-choose-a-good-research-question/#research-questions-are-survival-beacons) because they should guide all aspects of our research plans. You shouldn't start an evaluation process without a clear research question.

We will re-do the activity from the lecture in groups to develop RQs and set out a clear evaluation plan.

Remember [the steps for writing a research question](https://smcclab.github.io/thirty-nine-hundred-hci/lectures/08-evaluation.html#/four-steps-to-write-a-research-question):

1. Outline a broad area of interest
2. Identify a problem that needs solving
3. Justify solving this problem
4. Write the question

As a small group, [Spin the wheels](https://spinthewheel.io/wheels/6QtocP77prRkdHZ66s0hcz0xJmU9MA==) to **randomly find a broad area and a problem**.

Then, you will need to come up with a justification (no wheels for that...) and write the question. The RQ should include the broad area, the problem, and the justification. Remember that a research question starts with a question word (what, how, why, can, do, should) and ends with a question mark. It can just be one sentence.

Iterate on your question until you feel it will help you plan an evaluation.

**Tips:**

- If your question isn't working or is too general, try a different question word to change the focus.
- Check if your question will be answerable. Unsolveable questions are unhelpful as RQs.
- Check if you question is obvious. Research is (by definition) an activity to generate non-obvious knowledge.

### Task 3: Evaluation Plan

Make an evaluation plan following this slide. Maybe split into two tasks...

### Task 4: something else?


## Resources (optional)

You can include a section with links to external resources that may be necessary but these can also be placed in-line with the tasks.

## References

(reference list is added automatically but we need the heading to stay there)
