<!-- ![tutorial image goes here, a nice indicative image in wide format, e.g. 1200x650](img/image-name.jpg) -->

This tutorial will help you to build prototypes that go beyond manifesting a design concept, but are ready for evaluation. This work is directly related to the final project.

<!-- half making, half testing on each other. -->

## Pre-Class Tasks

The pre-class task(s) need to be _ultra clear_ so that students can complete them before the tutorial without assistance from staff.

Refer to the assessment page `00-pre-and-in-class-tasks.md` to see what students are expected to do. The task should involve reading, thinking, and/or doing with the outcome as:

- 100-200 word post on the course forum including
- at least two references
- possibly one image

The task should be something that can be assessed so should include possibility for different levels of achievement (e.g., a really basic response or a detailed and outstanding response).

The task will be checked by the tutor at the start of the lab (by filtering by category in the course forum).

## Plan for the Class

You could include a schedule here for what will happen in the class. This will benefit the tutor as they can keep on track. Each required in-class task should have a different point in a numbered list.

1. look at pre-class tasks (20m)
2. Task 1: do something (30m)
3. Task 2: do something else (20m)
4. Task 3: an even more interesting, and yet different, thing (20m)
5. Extra Tasks (if time)
6. Individual consultation time (30m drop-in following tutorial)

## In-Class Tasks

The in class tasks should each have a separate heading at the `###` level. The task descriptions need to be clear enough to students to potentially complete on their own (if absent) and to tutors to run as a class. I suggest that some tasks involve individual work, and some involve collaborative work in groups of 4--6 students (e.g., tables in standard classrooms), and some involve whole class discussions (e.g., building a Miro board)

The tasks should have a deliverable that tutors can sight at the end of the task to verify students have engaged with work. E.g., a document, an image, a sketch, a prototype, a program, a plan, a reference list, a contribution to the miro board etc.

The 90-minute classes should have 2-4 required tasks with the regular expectation being 3 taking around 20 minutes each.

It's a good idea to provide an Extra Task in case the regular tasks are quicker than expected or if a student is very fast through work.

### Task 1: Do Something

Here's the task description. Task descriptions should have some references so that the class is research-led. We want to continually point students to CHI papers [@rogers-never-old:2014] etc so that they are reminded of the context of HCI research [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023, p.100; @Norman:2013].

## Resources (optional)

You can include a section with links to external resources that may be necessary but these can also be placed in-line with the tasks.

## References

(reference list is added automatically but we need the heading to stay there)
