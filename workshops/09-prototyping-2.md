This tutorial will help you to build prototypes that go beyond manifesting a design concept, but are ready for evaluation. This work is directly related to the final project.

<!-- half making, half testing on each other. -->

What makes a prototype testable? 
A prototype is testable if it lets you observe and learn from real user interactions. Ask yourself these questions about your prototype:
1. Interactive: Can users actually perform the steps or tasks you’re trying to test? (even if simulated)
2. Clear: Can users understand what the system is, what to do, and how it works?
3. Evaluative: Can you observe users, gather feedback, or identify what works and what doesn’t?
4. Focused: Are you including only what’s needed to test the intended interaction or task?

how can i maek the above more specific?

look a this paper:

<https://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs247/2012/readings/WhatDoPrototypesPrototype.pdf>

maybe for deciding on a testable prototype we don't need to maximise all aspects, but to efficiently create something that enables testing without spending an overwhelming amount of effort on creating the prototype.

## Pre-Class Tasks

The pre-class task(s) need to be _ultra clear_ so that students can complete them before the tutorial without assistance from staff.

Refer to the assessment page `00-pre-and-in-class-tasks.md` to see what students are expected to do. The task should involve reading, thinking, and/or doing with the outcome as:

- 100-200 word post on the course forum including
- at least two references
- possibly one image

The task should be something that can be assessed so should include possibility for different levels of achievement (e.g., a really basic response or a detailed and outstanding response).

The task will be checked by the tutor at the start of the lab (by filtering by category in the course forum).

Choose a user interface described in a UIST or CHI paper (https://dl.acm.org/conference/uist

## Plan for the Class

You could include a schedule here for what will happen in the class. This will benefit the tutor as they can keep on track. Each required in-class task should have a different point in a numbered list.

1. look at pre-class tasks (20m)
2. Task 1: do something (30m)
3. Task 2: do something else (20m)
4. Task 3: an even more interesting, and yet different, thing (20m)
5. Extra Tasks (if time)
6. Individual consultation time (30m drop-in following tutorial)

## In-Class Tasks

The in class tasks should each have a separate heading at the `###` level. The task descriptions need to be clear enough to students to potentially complete on their own (if absent) and to tutors to run as a class. I suggest that some tasks involve individual work, and some involve collaborative work in groups of 4--6 students (e.g., tables in standard classrooms), and some involve whole class discussions (e.g., building a Miro board)

The tasks should have a deliverable that tutors can sight at the end of the task to verify students have engaged with work. E.g., a document, an image, a sketch, a prototype, a program, a plan, a reference list, a contribution to the miro board etc.

The 90-minute classes should have 2-4 required tasks with the regular expectation being 3 taking around 20 minutes each.

It's a good idea to provide an Extra Task in case the regular tasks are quicker than expected or if a student is very fast through work.

### Task 1: Do Something


- choose one group members paper
- identify the intera

What makes a prototype testable? 
A prototype is testable if it lets you observe and learn from real user interactions. Ask yourself these questions about your prototype:
1. Interactive: Can users actually perform the steps or tasks you’re trying to test? (even if simulated)
2. Clear: Can users understand what the system is, what to do, and how it works?
3. Evaluative: Can you observe users, gather feedback, or identify what works and what doesn’t?
4. Focused: Are you including only what’s needed to test the intended interaction or task?

Here's the task description. Task descriptions should have some references so that the class is research-led. We want to continually point students to CHI papers [@rogers-never-old:2014] etc so that they are reminded of the context of HCI research [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023, p.100; @Norman:2013].

### Task 2: Build a Testable Prototype (30 mins)

In groups, your tutor will give you a **random user problem**. Your task is to:  

1. **Identify the key interaction** you want to focus on testing.  
2. **Sketch and build a testable prototype** based on that key interaction.  

Your prototype should be:  

- **Interactive** – Users should be able to perform the intended task or workflow.  
- **Clear** – Users should understand what the system is and what to do.  
- **Evaluative** – You should be able to gather feedback or observe user behaviour.  

**Guidelines:**  
- Focus only on the **essential elements needed to test the interaction** — do not worry about polish or aesthetics.  
- Materials can include **paper, printed screens, simple click-through slides, or other low-fidelity tools**.  
- Use a **Wizard of Oz** approach if you need to simulate system responses.

### Task 3: Prototype Showcase & Peer Feedback (30 mins)

Groups will **present and demonstrate their testable prototypes** to the class, allowing peers to interact and provide feedback. The focus is on **observing real user interactions**, not just explaining how the prototype works.  

**Steps:**  

1. **Group Demo (1 min per group)**  
   - Introduce the **user problem and scenario** your prototype addresses.  
   - Highlight the **key interaction** your prototype supports.  
   - **Do not explain exactly how it works** — let classmates discover the interaction by using the prototype.  

2. **Class Interaction (2–3 mins per group)**  
   - A few classmates at a time try the prototype, following the key interaction steps.  
   - Observers should take notes on:  
     - Where users succeed or complete the task easily  
     - Where users hesitate or get confused  

3. **Rapid Feedback (1 min per group)**  
   - Peers provide quick feedback on:  
     - Could they complete the task?  
     - What felt intuitive or effective?  
     - What was confusing or unclear?  

4. **Group Reflection (30 sec per group)**  
   - Each group identifies **one key takeaway or improvement** based on the feedback.

- of increasingly impossible tasks

## Resources (optional)

You can include a section with links to external resources that may be necessary but these can also be placed in-line with the tasks.

## References

(reference list is added automatically but we need the heading to stay there)
