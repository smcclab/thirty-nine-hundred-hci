In this class we will practice administering some of the classic questionnaire instruments in usability, the SUS (System Usability Scale) and NASA TLX (Task Load Index). 

These questionnaires are widely used in assessing how users perceive a user interface. Questionnaires like these are useful in gaining numerical information from a medium to large group of users quickly. They can be particularly useful in comparing different interactive systems, situations or user types as you can use statistical techniques to assess differences between samples. 

In today's tutorial, you will do a mock survey with a user interface that we provide and the SUS and TLX instruments. You will collect data together with others in the class and calculate decriptive statistics, generate plots, and perform significance testing using Python.


## Pre-Class Tasks

1. Read the following article from NNgroup on the SUS and TLX: <https://www.nngroup.com/articles/measuring-perceived-usability/>
2. Find a quantitative or rating-scale style survey somewhere in the world, take a photo or screenshot.
3. Post on the forum with your image and explain: 1) what the survey is and where you found it, 2) what type of data is captured, 3) how it is similar or different to the SUS and NASA TLX discussed in the article.

## Plan for the Class

In this class, you will:

1. Practice administering the SUS or TLX (25 minutes)
2. Analyse your quantitative data (40 minutes)
3. Discuss what you learned (15 minutes)

## In-Class Tasks

### 0. Discuss pre-class responses (10 minutes)

The tutor will bring up the pre-class responses on the big screen and lead you in a discussion. Some questions might be:

- What kind of survey or rating scale did you choose?
- When might you use this survey or rating scale?
- How long might it take for a user to complete this scale?
- What kinds of issues or difficulties might a user encounter when completing this scale?

### 1. Administer the SUS or TLX
TODO

### 2. Analyse your quantitive data
TODO

### 3. Discuss your key learnings

Your tutor will lead you in a discussion about what you learned from using the SUS or TLX, and analysis process. 

- What did you find?
- How easy or difficult was it to use the scale?
- What would you do differently next time?
