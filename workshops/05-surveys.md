In this class we will practice administering some of the classic questionnaire instruments in usability, the SUS (System Usability Scale) and NASA TLX (Task Load Index). 

These questionnaires are widely used in assessing how users perceive a user interface. Questionnaires like these are useful in gaining numerical information from a medium to large group of users quickly. They can be particularly useful in comparing different interactive systems, situations or user types as you can use statistical techniques to assess differences between samples. 

In today's tutorial, you will do a mock survey with a user interface that we provide and the SUS and TLX instruments. You will collect data together with others in the class and calculate decriptive statistics, generate plots, and perform significance testing using Python.


## Pre-Class Tasks

1. Read the following article from NNgroup on the SUS and TLX: <https://www.nngroup.com/articles/measuring-perceived-usability/>
2. Find a quantitative or rating-scale style survey somewhere in the world, take a photo or screenshot.
3. Post on the forum with your image and explain: 1) what the survey is and where you found it, 2) what type of data is captured, 3) how it is similar or different to the SUS and NASA TLX discussed in the article.
