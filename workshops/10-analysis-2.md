title: Analysing Evaluations

<!-- ![tutorial image goes here, a nice indicative image in wide format, e.g. 1200x650](img/image-name.jpg) -->

This tutorial is focussed on how to analyse the information found through an evaluation and how to develop that knowledge into design recommendations. This work is directly related to the final project.

<!-- link this to previous one. -->

- What is a finding?
- Further guided examples on how to create themes
  - need videos, more guided 
- Going from numbers to a finding
- Synthesising (triangulating) insights from different aspects of evaluation to develop a finding.

<!-- Anneysha will contribute to some of this! -->


## Pre-Class Tasks

The pre-class task(s) need to be _ultra clear_ so that students can complete them before the tutorial without assistance from staff.

Refer to the assessment page `00-pre-and-in-class-tasks.md` to see what students are expected to do. The task should involve reading, thinking, and/or doing with the outcome as:

- 100-200 word post on the course forum including
- at least two references
- possibly one image

The task should be something that can be assessed so should include possibility for different levels of achievement (e.g., a really basic response or a detailed and outstanding response).

The task will be checked by the tutor at the start of the lab (by filtering by category in the course forum).

## Plan for the Class

You could include a schedule here for what will happen in the class. This will benefit the tutor as they can keep on track. Each required in-class task should have a different point in a numbered list.

1. look at pre-class tasks (20m)
2. Task 1: do something (30m)
3. Task 2: do something else (20m)
4. Task 3: an even more interesting, and yet different, thing (20m)
5. Extra Tasks (if time)
6. Individual consultation time (30m drop-in following tutorial)

## In-Class Tasks

The in class tasks should each have a separate heading at the `###` level. The task descriptions need to be clear enough to students to potentially complete on their own (if absent) and to tutors to run as a class. I suggest that some tasks involve individual work, and some involve collaborative work in groups of 4--6 students (e.g., tables in standard classrooms), and some involve whole class discussions (e.g., building a Miro board)

The tasks should have a deliverable that tutors can sight at the end of the task to verify students have engaged with work. E.g., a document, an image, a sketch, a prototype, a program, a plan, a reference list, a contribution to the miro board etc.

The 90-minute classes should have 2-4 required tasks with the regular expectation being 3 taking around 20 minutes each.

It's a good idea to provide an Extra Task in case the regular tasks are quicker than expected or if a student is very fast through work.

### Task 1: Do Something

Here's the task description. Task descriptions should have some references so that the class is research-led. We want to continually point students to CHI papers [@rogers-never-old:2014] etc so that they are reminded of the context of HCI research [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023, p.100; @Norman:2013].

## Resources (optional)

You can include a section with links to external resources that may be necessary but these can also be placed in-line with the tasks.

## References

(reference list is added automatically but we need the heading to stay there)
