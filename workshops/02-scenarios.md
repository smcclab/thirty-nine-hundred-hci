## Pre-Class Tasks

<!-- TODO: need a relevant pre-class task with clear output 100-200 word post on forum, should require reading the textbook or a resource on personas and scenarios -->

## Plan for the Class

The tutorial will follow this structure:

2. Design product analysis (25 minutes)
3. Reporting back and discussion (15 minutes)
4. Questions and tutorial close (5 minutes)

## In-Class Tasks

### Make your name card

- You will be asked to create a name tag for yourself with the name that
  you would like others to call you, your pronouns, and a
  (**workplace-appropriate**) emoji, symbol, or Zoom background that
  reflects your interests or identity.

- For in-person tutorials, you will be handed a sheet of card to fold
  and write your name on. For online tutorials, you will be asked to
  rename yourself in Zoom interface.

- Your Tutor(s) and other students will use the name cards to get to
  know you and refer to you correctly in the course. The Tutor(s) will
  also use the name card information to take attendance. **Please ensure
  that you return you name card to your Tutor(s) at the end of each
  tutorial.**

- If you preferred name is different to the name that you have used to enrol in the course, please write your actual name on the bottom of your name card, or for Zoom participants, put it in brackets or tell your Tutors (to help them take attendance).

Example name card: Jennyfer (she/her/hers)

For further information about what pronouns are, and why we ask you to write your pronouns on your name card, please see the ANU webpage on [Gender Inclusive Language](https://services.anu.edu.au/human-resources/respect-inclusion/gender-inclusive-language).

### Design product analysis (25 minutes)

Your Tutor(s) will randomly allocate you into 3-4 groups.

Introduce yourself to the other students in your group.

Consider the following design product categories, and identify which design product you think would provide the best user experience in the scenarios provided. There is no right or wrong answer, but the skill you are practicing is how to convincingly make your case with reference to specifics. You should analyse user experiences in relation to the following criteria:

- Adherence to usability goals and design principles (from Lectures Week 1)

- Your own experiences of using these technologies and the feelings or emotions that they elicit (and why)

- Metaphors used and interaction modalities offered by the design.

- The people and context that the scenario relates to (see Lectures Week 1 slide 52). Think about what information is **not provided** and what assumptions you therefore need to make about the scenario.

### Design Product Categories And Scenarios

#### Video Calling or Conferencing Platforms (e.g., Skype, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Facetime, WeChat Video)

Which video calling or conferencing platform listed above, or that you are familiar with, would provide the best user experience in the following scenarios?

- Scenario A: A school teaching online classes to students aged 13-18
  years old at home (approx. 25-30 students in each class)

- Scenario B: Grandparents communicating regularly with their young
  grandchildren (aged 3-5) who live far away from them

#### Navigation Apps (e.g., Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze)

Which navigation app listed above, or that you are familiar with, would
provide the best user experience in the following scenarios?

- Scenario C: Visiting a new city on holidays for the first time, and
  navigating from the airport to your hotel using public transport.

- Scenario D: Navigating while riding your bike from one place to
  another in your hometown/city (without a mobile phone mount on your
  bike)

#### Music Playing Platforms (e.g., iTunes, Spotify, YouTube Music)

(use only if there is time remaining in your group discussion...)

Which music playing platform listed above, or that you are familiar
with, would provide the best user experience in the following scenarios?

- Scenario E: Privately listening to music/podcasts while taking public
  transport somewhere

- Scenario F: Creating and listening to a playlist of background music
  at a social work function

  a.  While you are doing this activity, your Tutor will check in with
      you and ask you what your chosen making activity is for Project 1.
      Your Tutor can give feedback as to whether this is an appropriate
      choice for the assessment tasks.

### Reporting back and discussion (15 minutes)

The tutor will bring you back together for a whole group discussion to reflect on what you learnt and observed.

Your tutor will work by scenario, and for each scenario from A-D ask each group to share which design product they chose, and the key reason(s) for your choice.

Make sure that you succinctly present your main argument and key examples that support this (no more than 30 seconds each group
approx.).

Your tutor will facilitate discussion about your responses, and address scenarios E-F if you have time.
