title: Prototyping
author: Dr Jennyfer Lawrence Taylor
---

The purpose of this tutorial is to give you hands-on experience in
low-fidelity prototyping, which is a key task in the Prototype Design
and Presentation Assessment. You will work with your team members in
your project group.

The intended learning outcomes of this tutorial are to:

- Develop scenarios and storyboards based on user research;
- Prototype through storyboarding; and
- Critically analyse design decisions.

## Pre-Class Tasks

You should complete the following activities prior to attending your
tutorial:

1.  Review the lecture content for Week 6 on **Ideation** and Week 7 on
    **Prototyping.**

2.  Read **Chapter 12 Design, Prototyping, and Construction** in Sharp
    et al. 2019 *Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction*
    (Sharp, Preece & Rogers 2019) -- Available as an e-book through ANU
    Library website.

3.  Make sure that your group has completed you ideation activities for
    6.2.3 Ideation and Low-Fidelity Prototype (for Peer Feedback) (0% -
    ungraded) (p.35) for both methods (10 ideas total). Bring your list
    of ideas to the tutorial.


## Plan for the Class

The tutorial will follow this structure:

1.  Develop a set of scenarios (15 mins)
2.  Sketch out storyboards based on scenarios (15 mins)
3.  Present and discuss storyboards in groups (15 mins)
4.  Report back and close (5 mins)

## In-Class Tasks


### Develop a set of scenarios (15 mins)

1.  Your Tutor will place you in group.

2.  Choose your three best design ideas.

3.  Generate a selection of scenarios in your group that involve the
    use of each of those three technology designs. Ensure you
    generate at least as many scenarios as group members for each
    design idea.

4.  Assign one scenario to each group member to work on.

### Sketch out storyboards based on scenarios (15 mins)

Stay in groups but work individually to develop each
scenario into a storyboard. Think through the steps that might
be involved in the scenario and the personas involved, and draw
up rough sketches to illustrate each step.

### Present and discuss storyboards in groups (15 mins)

In your project groups, present your storyboard to each other
and discuss as a group:

1. What is the goal of the storyboard?
2. What did you learn from developing the storyboard?
3. What design decisions did you make when developing this storyboard?

Decide whether the storyboard represents your 'best idea' that
your group will carry forward for your low-fidelity prototype
design.

1.  If so, what further work needs to be done to it to ensure
    that it is ready to present for peer feedback in the Week 9
    tutorial as your low-fidelity prototype?

2.  If not, what alternative design direction will you take, and
    how will you present this as a low-fidelity prototype for
    the Week 9 peer feedback session?

### Report back and close (5 mins)

Your Tutor will bring everyone back together.
The Tutor will bring the tutorial to a close and answer any questions if time.
