The purpose of this tutorial is to give you hands-on experience in low-fidelity prototyping, which is a key task in the Prototyping Assignment. Sketching and prototyping 

"A prototype is one manifestation of a design that allows stakeholders to interact with it and to explore its suitability" [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023]

## Pre-Class Tasks

 **You must complete these tasks before the start of your tutorial.**

1.  Review the lecture content for Week 2 on **Design** and Week 3 on
    **Guidelines, Principles and Theories**

2.  Read **Chapter 12 Design, Prototyping, and Construction** in Sharp
    et al. 2019 *Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction*
    (Sharp, Preece & Rogers 2019) -- Available as an e-book through ANU
    Library website.

3.  Post a forum post following the instructions below. 

Choose one object/interface that you have come across in your life that you think has a 'bad' design. Consider it's use cases, functionalities, forms, and overall design features. 

Sketch and annotate the bad design, and upload it with your forum post (100-200 words) about this object/interface using these prompts:

- Briefly introduce your chosen object/interface and how you came across it. 
- What is its core functionality? What form of interaction is it designed for? 
- Why is it 'bad'? What would you do to improve the design? 

Bring your sketch and/or the object/interface in to class this week if possible for discussion. 

## Plan for the Class

The tutorial will follow this structure:

0.  Discuss pre-class tasks 
1.  Ideation 
2.  Paper Prototypes 
3.  Discussion 

## In-Class Tasks

### 0. Discuss pre-class tasks & construct a scenario (20 mins)

As a class or in groups of 4-5, introduce your chosen objects/interfaces to each other and consider the following prompts:

- What is its intended functionality? 
- In what context or situation might someone need this functionality? 
- Who are the actors (personas) using this object/interface?
- What is motivating these actors in the scenario?
- What specific intention do they have in this situation?
- What action do these actors take with the object/interface?
- What is the resolution or outcome of this interaction?

Responding to those will help construct one scenario we will be ideating and prototyping based on today. Recall from last week's lab that scenarios should include these elements:

- an actor (your persona)
- a motivator
- an intention or intent
- an action
- a resolution

### 1.1 Rapid Brainstorming (20 mins)

Staying in the same groups, we will do some rapid brainstorming to generate design ideas. Guided by your scenario above, we will be generating solutions to redesign the object/interface here. You may want to come up with changes to the existing interface, or come up with a completely new solution for the scenario. Our only request here is that your solution should be computer-based. This doesn't have to be digital, but should be facilitated by a computer in some way. 

One methodology often used in design thinking is called "Crazy 8's" where you have 8 minutes to sketch out 8 ideas. [@google-crazy8] The ideas can be as good or bad as you want them to be. Your main objective is to come up with eight distinct ideas. The sketches don't have to be perfect, as long as they communicate your idea. 

- Each person will get one A3 piece of paper, and they will fold it into 8 sections. 
- Your tutor will start an 8 minute timer for you to begin sketching your ideas.
- Individually, each person will sketch one idea in each of the 8 rectangles. Sketches can be either drawn or written (or both!). 
- When the timer is up, all pens down. 

After you finish, lay out all your ideas and walk around to read each of your other group members' ideas. Give yourself a few minutes to understand everyones ideas. Now it's time to vote on your best idea. 

- Each person will get 3 votes.
- You vote by drawing a star in the idea's rectangle, you can vote for an idea more than once if you think it deserves two or all three of your votes. 
- Come back together and finalise your best design.


### 1.2 Sketch out storyboards based on scenarios (10 mins)

Stay in groups but work individually to develop your chosen idea into a storyboard. Think through the steps that might be involved in the scenario and the personas involved, and draw up rough sketches to illustrate each step. Consider all moving parts discussed above, and try and decide on the key steps. You'll only have 10 minutes which means these do not have to be perfect in any way. The idea here is that we are trying to sketch out the tangible steps in interacting with your design/idea. 

### 1.3 Present and discuss storyboards in groups (10 mins)

In your groups, present your storyboards to each other and discuss as a group:

1. What is the goal of the storyboard?
2. What did you learn from developing the storyboard?
3. What design decisions did you make when developing this storyboard?
4. What were the differences between your individual storyboards? What would be the key components in this interaction? 

Decide which of your storyboards represents your 'best idea' that your group will carry forward for your paper prototyping in the next activity. You can also quickly draw up a new one that's a combination of all the best parts in your storyboards. 

### 2 Paper prototyping (30 mins)

"By their very nature, prototypes involve compromises. The intention is to produce something quickly to test an aspect of the product" [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023]

In your groups, create a paper prototype of your design. This should be a tangible version that walks someone through the storyboard you have developed. Materials will be provided

When creating your prototype, consider:

- What are the key components that your user or stakeholder needs to see and interact with in order to understand your design?
- What is the main purpose of this paper prototype? Which specific aspect(s) of your design are you aiming to test or demonstrate?
- How can you effectively convey your design using only paper as your material? How can you simulate interaction, feedback, or flow using paper elements?
