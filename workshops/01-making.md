This week we are going to start thinking about user experience and the meaning that computer systems have for us. Your pre-class task is going to start the process of reflecting on our own interests and patterns of computer use. In-class we will discuss and express our personal computing journeys through making.

While doing arts-and-crafts in a 3000-level computing course has been called _"a choice"_, it's a good way to slow down out thinking and start to consider what _experience_ means in computing.

## Pre-Class Tasks

Choose a computer or digital technology that played an important role in your early life. It could be a device, an application, or a website. Upload an image of this technology on the forum. You can upload a photo, sketch, or an image found online (remember to provide a reference).

Write a reflective post (100-200 words) about this technology using these prompts:

- What is this device and when did you first encounter it?
- What specific memories do you associate with it?
- How did it shape your relationship with computing?
- What emotions does thinking about it bring up now?

## Plan for the Class

In this class you will:

1. talk about an interactive technology that is meaningful to you
2. think and talk about usability and user experience
3. do some arts and crafts to reflect on this and start off the semester

## In-Class Tasks

### 1. Reflecting on Meaningful Technologies

Going beyond the technicalities of how we may facilitate human-computer interaction, let's consider how computers have already interacted with us in our lives. Today's lab is all about reflecting on our experiences with computers and how that impacts the work we do with computers and what we may create in future. 

Reflection is a cyclic and integral part of the creative process. There are many different frameworks of reflection for different use cases. [Driscoll’s “What?” Model](https://reflection.ed.ac.uk/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience/what-so-what-now-what) was developed in the mid-1990s, creating a cycle of the following three questions:

- What?
- So what?
- Now what?

It's important to reflect on the technology you chose in the pre-class tasks. Consider how it interacts with concepts of "usability" and "user experience" from the lecture.

In groups, discuss the following questions:

- What was your meaningful technology?
- Why was it important? What part of your user experience stands out?
- How does this impact the technologies you want to create?

As a class, find themes in the group discussions. What are the main experiences and ambitions of the tutorial group?

### 2. Thinking about User Experience

Now we'll be doing a blind drawing activity.

Draw the computer or digital technology that played an important role in _someone else's life_. Do this without looking at the paper while you draw (you can peek when you're done!). Think about how their experience shaped their perception of the system.

This isn’t about being a great artist — it's a way to loosen up and engage with user experience before we dive into more reflective making.

Once you've finished your drawing, take a few minutes to write about:

- What is this technology?
- What role did it play?
- How do _you_ feel about it?

### 3. Making to Express Experience and our Journeys

For the second half of the tutorial, we’ll make a small reflective zine.

A zine (short for magazine) is a small, self-published booklet often used for artistic or personal expression. Today, you'll make an 8-page zine that captures your personal journey with computing.

Your zine might include:

- A title page
- Drawings, diagrams, or comics
- Your reflection from earlier
- A page about your coding process
- A page about interactive systems you have made
- A short piece about how your relationship with computers has changed
- Anything else you want to add!

You can make this by folding and cutting a single A3 sheet (We'll show you how), or by stapling pages together if you prefer. 

Take your time with this — it's not about making something perfect, but something meaningful. I've brought in different materials you're welcome to use to create your responses.
