This week we are going to start thinking about user experience and the meaning that computer systems have for us. Your pre-class task is going to start the process of reflecting on our own interests and patterns of computer use. In-class we will discuss and express our personal computing journeys through making.

## Pre-Class Tasks

Choose a computer or digital technology that played an important role in your early life. It could be a device, an application, or a website. Upload an image of this technology on the forum. You can upload a photo, sketch, or an image found online (remember to provide a reference).

Write a reflective post (100-200 words) about this technology using these prompts:

- What is this device and when did you first encounter it?
- What specific memories do you associate with it?
- How did it shape your relationship with computing?
- What emotions does thinking about it bring up now?

## Plan for the Class

In this class you will:

1. talk about an interactive technology that is meaningful to you
2. think and talk about usability and user experience
3. do some arts and crafts to reflect on this and start off the semester

## In-Class Tasks

### 1. Talking about Meaningful Technologies

### 2. Thinking about User Experience

### 3. Making to Express Experience and our Journeys

As this term comes to a close, I thought it'd be good to turn away from our screens for a week and do some hands on artmaking together. Going beyond the technicalities of how we may facilitate human-computer interaction, let's consider how computers have already interacted with us in our lives. Today's lab is all about reflecting on our relationship with computers, how that impacts the work we do with computers, and critically considering how our creative code practices may have changed our relationship with computers. 


I introduced some reflection theory in [lab 11](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/extn1019/labs-year-12/11-interaction-reflection/#part-2-reflections), where [Driscoll's "What?" Model](https://reflection.ed.ac.uk/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience/what-so-what-now-what) creates a cycle of the following three questions:

- What?
- So what?
- Now what?

I think it's important to first reflect on everything we have done this term. Now that you have finished portfolio 3, consider:

- What did you learn?
- Why was it important? What did it make you curious about? 
- How will you apply this in the future? 

I would like you to write out your thoughts and responses to these questions. 

### Personal Histories

Now we'll be doing a blind drawing activity.

Draw a computer or digital technology that played an important role in your early life — maybe your first computer, a family gaming console, or even an old mobile phone. Do this without looking at the paper while you draw (you can peek when you're done!).

This isn’t about being a great artist — it's a way to loosen up and engage with memory and emotion before we dive into more reflective making.

Once you've finished your drawing, take a few minutes to write about:

- What is this technology?
- What role did it play in your life?
- How do you feel about it now?

### Zine Making

For the second half of the lab, we’ll be making a small reflective zine.

A zine (short for magazine) is a small, self-published booklet often used for artistic or personal expression. Today, you'll make an 8-page zine that captures your personal journey through this course.

Your zine might include:

- A title page
- Drawings, diagrams, or comics
- Your reflection from earlier
- A page about your creative coding process
- A short piece about how your relationship with computers has changed
- Anything else you want to add!

You can make this by folding and cutting a single A3 sheet (I'll show you how), or by stapling pages together if you prefer. 

Take your time with this — it's not about making something perfect, but something meaningful. I've brought in different materials you're welcome to use to create your responses.
