![We've made some prototypes --- now what? (Week 4 prototype demos from COMP3900 2025)](img/evaluation.jpg)

The purpose of this tutorial is to help you to design and conduct an evaluation activity.

The intended learning outcomes for this tutorial are to:

- Develop design evaluation goals
- Design evaluation activities using qualitative and quantitative methods
- Facilitate an evaluation activity with technology users
- Critically reflect on which evaluation methods can address particular kinds of evaluation goals and research questions

## Pre-Class Tasks

You should complete the following activities prior to attending your
tutorial:

1.  Review the lecture content on **Evaluation**

2.  Read the following chapters from *Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction* **Chapter 14 Introducing Evaluation**, **Chapter 15 Evaluation Studies: From Controlled to Natural Settings** [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023].

3. Write a forum post (100-200 words) summarising your research plan in preparation for [Assignment 2](https://canvas.anu.edu.au/courses/2781/assignments/11550). In your post, name the AI-integrated interface you have chosen to study, and explain why you selected it. Then briefly outline your research plan, including your strategies for data collection and the analysis framework(s) you intend to use. You must also include at least two references from relevant HCI literature---these could relate to prior studies in similar areas, research methodologies, conceptual frameworks, or other scholarly resources relevant to your topic.

Following on from the assignment work last week you should have:

- joined a group to complete your mini user studies
- chosen an AI-integrated interface to study

For this week's tutorial you need to **create a plan for your study**. Use your [research skills](https://scholar.google.com) to find examples of studies into human-AI interfaces (e.g., at CHI) and use them to help plan your study. Make sure your study plan is realistic.

Remember, for your study plan you need to collect quantitative and qualitative data so that you can report on an analysis of each type of data. You can choose what form that data is, e.g., quantitative data could be rating scale questionnaire questions, timed task completions, or number of clicks to complete a task. Qualitative data could be interviews, written reflections, images, videos, sounds, observations. For more ideas, see the lectures and the textbook!

## Plan for the Class

0.  Discuss pre-class tasks (10 mins)
1.  Plan your evaluation (50 mins)
2.  Meet with your group to discuss evaluation (30 mins)

## In-Class Tasks

### Discuss pre-class tasks (10 mins)

Your pre-class task asked you to describe your planned study for Assignment 2. 

Recall that the research question you will investigate is:

> "How do users' mental model of the AI system align with the behaviour of the system and what usability issues arise from any misalignments?"

Consider the following questions: 

- How does your study plan address the research question? 
- How have you ensured your study plan is feasible within the time constraints?
- Why does your chosen interface make sense for this research question?

### Planning your evaluation (50 mins)

This section of the tutorial is dedicated to articulating your evaluation plans a bit more thoroughly. 

- Choose a particular feature of your chosen AI interface that you wish to
  evaluate, that can facilitate a task for the user to complete.

- Choose one user experience AND one usability evaluation goal to
  focus on.

- Choose a task for the user to complete that would address your
  evaluation goals.

<!-- edited up to here 8 Sept 5pm ; gonna plan in comments for the rest for now  - SM -->

<!-- What are you going to do to actually gather your data? Quantitative data: name your sources, design your means of data gathering. Qualitative data: Will there be a script? -->

<!-- Ethical considerations/consent process -->

- Plan a 10-minute think aloud evaluation activity, where you ask
  the user to complete the task and think aloud as they are doing
  it.

  - Write down your instructions to participants as a script.

  - Ensure that you ask participants consent to take part in the
    evaluation task, and thank them for their time at the end.

  - You cannot record the 'participant'. You can only take
    handwritten notes that do not include any identifying
    information in them for the purpose of the tutorial discussion.

<!-- Planning analysis? Last week we did thematic analysis; week before that we did some SUS quantitative analysis; discuss in pairs what kind of analysis you are planning to do and why; consider why your chosen analysis is appropriate within the context of your research -->

### Conduct your evaluation activity in pairs (30 mins)


<!-- Meet with your group, discuss each of your evaluation plans, DECIDE ON TIME/PLACE WHEN YOU WILL CONDUCT YOUR DATA GATHERING!!!! It could be the drop in immediately after your tutorial! -->
- Your Tutor will automatically assign you to a break-out room with
  one other person at random.

  - It does not matter if they are not in the same project group as
    you, as this task does not relate to the Prototype Design and
    Presentation Assessment.

  - If there is an uneven number of participants, the Tutor will
    create a group of three.

- Take turns to conduct and participate in your evaluation activity
  in pairs.

  - If you are in the group of three, you can stay in your breakout
    room for the full 30 minutes rather than returning to the main
    room if you need more time.

- Discuss what the outcomes of your evaluation activities were, and
  whether they met your evaluation goals. Identify strengths and
  limitations to your evaluation approaches.
