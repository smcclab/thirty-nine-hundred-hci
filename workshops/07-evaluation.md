title: Planning Evaluations
author: Dr Jennyfer Lawrence Taylor
---

The purpose of this tutorial is to help you to design and conduct an evaluation activity.

The intended learning outcomes for this tutorial are to:

- Develop design evaluation goals
- Design evaluation activities using qualitative methods
- Facilitate an evaluation activity with technology users
- Critically reflect on which evaluation methods can address particular
  kinds of evaluation goals and research questions

## Pre-Class Tasks

You should complete the following activities prior to attending your
tutorial:

1.  Review the lecture content on **Evaluation**

2.  Read the following chapters from *Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction* **Chapter 14 Introducing Evaluation**, **Chapter 15 Evaluation Studies: From Controlled to Natural Settings** [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023].

3.  Familiarise yourself with the ANU's publicly facing website and its features, as you will be evaluating the ANU website in the tutorial this week: <https://www.anu.edu.au>. Particular areas of the ANU website that you might like to focus on are:

    - **Accommodation portal:**
      <https://www.anu.edu.au/study/accommodation>
    - **Programs and courses:** <https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au>
    - **Academic skills:** <https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills>
    - **Campus map:** <https://www.anu.edu.au/maps#>
    - **ANU Library:** <https://anulib.anu.edu.au>
    - **Events calendar:** <https://www.anu.edu.au/events>
    - **Careers site:** <https://www.anu.edu.au/students/careers-opportunities/careers>
    - **Jobs portal:** <https://www.anu.edu.au/jobs>

Following on from the assignment work last week you should have:

- joined a group to complete your mini user studies
- chosen an AI-integrated interface to study

For this week's tutorial you need to **create a plan for your study**. Use your [research skills](https://scholar.google.com) to find examples of studies into human-AI interfaces (e.g., at CHI) and use them to help plan your study. Make sure your study plan is realistic.

Remember, for your study plan you need to collect quantitative and qualitative data so that you can report on an analysis of each type of data. You can choose what form that data is, e.g., quantitative data could be rating scale questionnaire questions, timed task completions, or number of clicks to complete a task. Qualitative data could be interviews, written reflections, images, videos, sounds, observations. For more ideas, see the lectures and the textbook!

## Plan for the Class

1.  Plan your evaluation activity - individually (10 mins)
2.  Conduct your evaluation activity in pairs (30 mins)
3.  Report back and close (10 mins)

## In-Class Tasks

### Plan your evaluation activity - individually (10 mins)

- Choose a particular feature of the ANU website that you wish to
  evaluate, that can facilitate a task for the user to complete
  (e.g., finding ANU accommodation choices that satisfy X criteria).

  - You can choose one of the areas listed above, or another area of
    this website not on the list. Choose an area of the ANU website
    that **does not** require logging in (i.e., a publicly
    accessible part of the website).

- Choose one user experience AND one usability evaluation goal to
  focus on.

- Choose a task for the user to complete that would address your
  evaluation goals.

- Plan a 10-minute think aloud evaluation activity, where you ask
  the user to complete the task and think aloud as they are doing
  it.

  - Write down your instructions to participants as a script.

  - Ensure that you ask participants consent to take part in the
    evaluation task, and thank them for their time at the end.

  - You cannot record the 'participant'. You can only take
    handwritten notes that do not include any identifying
    information in them for the purpose of the tutorial discussion.

### Conduct your evaluation activity in pairs (30 mins)

- Your Tutor will automatically assign you to a break-out room with
  one other person at random.

  - It does not matter if they are not in the same project group as
    you, as this task does not relate to the Prototype Design and
    Presentation Assessment.

  - If there is an uneven number of participants, the Tutor will
    create a group of three.

- Take turns to conduct and participate in your evaluation activity
  in pairs.

  - If you are in the group of three, you can stay in your breakout
    room for the full 30 minutes rather than returning to the main
    room if you need more time.

- Discuss what the outcomes of your evaluation activities were, and
  whether they met your evaluation goals. Identify strengths and
  limitations to your evaluation approaches.

### Report back and close (10 mins)

The Tutor will bring everyone back together for a discussion, addressing the following questions:

- What were your evaluation goals? What were the findings from your evaluation activity?

- What did you learn about facilitating evaluation activities? How will you improve your skills as a facilitator based on your experiences in this tutorial?

- What were the limitations or constraints to your approach?

- Would this be a useful evaluation approach to take if you were to run an evaluation study of your high-fidelity prototype? Why/why not?
