![We've made some prototypes --- now what? (Week 4 prototype demos from COMP3900 2025)](img/evaluation.jpg)

The purpose of this tutorial is to help you to design and conduct an evaluation activity.

The intended learning outcomes for this tutorial are to:

- Develop design evaluation goals
- Design evaluation activities using qualitative and quantitative methods
- Facilitate an evaluation activity with technology users
- Critically reflect on which evaluation methods can address particular kinds of evaluation goals and research questions

## Pre-Class Tasks

You should complete the following activities prior to attending your tutorial:

1.  Review the lecture content on **Evaluation**

2.  Read the following chapters from *Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction* **Chapter 14 Introducing Evaluation**, **Chapter 15 Evaluation Studies: From Controlled to Natural Settings** [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023].

3. Write a forum post (100-200 words) summarising your research plan in preparation for [Assignment 2](https://canvas.anu.edu.au/courses/2781/assignments/11550). In your post, name the AI-integrated interface you have chosen to study, and explain why you selected it. Then briefly outline your research plan, including your strategies for data collection and the analysis framework(s) you intend to use. You must also include at least two references from relevant HCI literature---these could relate to prior studies in similar areas, research methodologies, conceptual frameworks, or other scholarly resources relevant to your topic.

Following on from the assignment work last week you should have:

- joined a group to complete your mini user studies
- chosen an AI-integrated interface to study

For this week's tutorial you need to **create a plan for your study**. Use your [research skills](https://scholar.google.com) to find examples of studies into human-AI interfaces (e.g., at CHI) and use them to help plan your study. Make sure your study plan is realistic.

Remember, for your study plan you need to collect quantitative and qualitative data so that you can report on an analysis of each type of data. You can choose what form that data is, e.g., quantitative data could be rating scale questionnaire questions, timed task completions, or number of clicks to complete a task. Qualitative data could be interviews, written reflections, images, videos, sounds, observations. For more ideas, see the lectures and the textbook!

## Plan for the Class

0.  Discuss pre-class tasks (10 mins)
1.  Plan your evaluation (50 mins)
2.  Meet with your group to discuss evaluation (30 mins)

## In-Class Tasks

### Discuss pre-class tasks (10 mins)

Your pre-class task asked you to describe your planned study for Assignment 2. 

Recall that the research question you will investigate is:

> "How do users' mental model of the AI system align with the behaviour of the system and what usability issues arise from any misalignments?"

Consider the following questions: 

- How does your study plan address the research question? 
- How have you ensured your study plan is feasible within the time constraints?
- Why does your chosen interface make sense for this research question?

### Planning your evaluation (50 mins)

This section of the tutorial is dedicated to articulating your evaluation plans a bit more thoroughly. 

- Choose a particular feature of your chosen AI interface that you wish to evaluate, that can facilitate a task for the user to complete.

- Choose one user experience AND one usability evaluation goal to focus on.

- Choose a task for the user to complete that would address your evaluation goals.

Now it's time to consider your data collection. Recall that we are expecting both quantitative and qualitative within the scope of this course. 

- How will you collect your data? Why have you chosen these methods? 

- Write up your means of data gathering. Consider what data you are trying to gather and how it contributes to your evaluation goal.

- What kind of data will you be collecting? How will you ensure that no identifiable information is gathered from participants. 

As makers/learners/developers/academics/humans, it's important to consider the ethical implications of any of our own output. When doing research with human participants, it's important to consider human ethics, and abide by any relevant codes of conduct. 

- Describe the consent process you plan on using in this assignment. What are the considerations of your specific research plan and how are they relevant? 

- How will you address any concerns from the participants before they engage in the evaluation? 

- Summarise your ethical considerations in 2-3 sentences and post it on the forum. Your tutor will create a thread for your tutorial. 

After you have gathered your data, it's time for analysis! In last week's workshop, we introduced thematic analysis, and the workshop before that was a quick overview of quantitative analysis. 

- Find a partner who is not in your research group, and discuss what kind of analysis you are planning to do and why. Consider why your chosen analysis methodology is appropriate within the context of your research. 

- Articulate and write down your plan for data analysis. This will be helpful for when you're completing the Assignment! 

### Research 'cluster' meeting (30 mins)

The last 30 minutes of this workshop is dedicated to meeting with your group and working out the logistics of completing your evaluations. 

As a group you should: 

- Talk through your overall evaluation plans with your group, and make sure to address any concerns your participants might have. You don’t need to go into the details of your specific data collection questions (that will come during the actual evaluation), but be clear about what you’ll be asking participants to do and what their involvement will look like.

- Decide on the time and place when you will conduct your data gathering. Remember that every tutorial in the course is followed by a 30 minute drop-in --- this means the room is booked and free to use for this course! 

- Do your evaluations! If you have time, you might like to take turns to conduct and participate in your evaluation activities in pairs. 


### Wrapping up

Good luck with completing Assignment 2! Remember that it is due next Monday 29th September 2025, 23:59 AEST. 

After you have completed your analysis, it's helpful to reflect on the following: 

- Discuss what the outcomes of your evaluation activities were, and whether they met your evaluation goals. Identify strengths and limitations to your evaluation approaches.
