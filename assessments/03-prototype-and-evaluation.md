## Description {#description}

The final project involves a complete design and evaluation process for a prototype interactive system. 
You must design a prototype system in response to a real-world problem. You will evaluate this system and report on the results using HCI research methods. Your design and evaluation challenge is as follows

> **sustainable living through technology**: You woke up this morning, checked your email, and found that you have a new job---ANU Student Lead for Sustainable Living! Your challenge is to help university students adopt sustainable behaviours in their everyday lives guided by the [UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) which call for urgent action on climate change, responsible consumption, and sustainable communities. You will need to choose a focus (e.g., energy use, waste reduction, transportation, consumption) and prototype and evaluate an interface to make sustainable living more accessible, engaging or effective. Your system should involve a level of non-standard interaction[^nonstandardinteraction], either through unusual use of standard computer IO hardware, or a novel interface. 

[^nonstandardinteraction]: Non-standard interaction is a bit difficult to define but should be something that goes beyond a standard web-application operated only by keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen. Your prototype can involve these standard technologies, it should also involve interaction beyond them in some way.

To address this challenge, you will need to develop a specific **research question** that incorporates your area of interaction, a problem, and a justification. You will need to design a **testable prototype**, and create an **evaluation plan**. You will need to run an **evaluation** of your prototype with 3--5 classmates, **analyse data**, and **articulate findings** that connect to your research question.

Your work will be submitted as a portfolio including your prototype materials, research data, analysis, references, and a presentation.
The presentation should cover the research question, design rationale, prototype demonstration, evaluation methodology, and results. 

Postgraduate students have an addition requirement to reflect critically on your presence within the design and evaluation process.




<!-- 
Something like:
- take an existing product or system that helps people to complete a task
- create a prototype that uses a different interface to solve the same problem.
- evaluate your prototype with 3--5 other students from the class.
