## Description {#description}

The final project involves a complete design and evaluation process for a prototype interactive system. 
You must design a prototype system in response to a real-world problem. You will evaluate this system and report on the results using HCI research methods.

Your work will be submitted as a portfolio including your prototype materials, research data, analysis, references, and a presentation.
The presentation should cover problem identification, design rationale, prototype demonstration, evaluation methodology, and results. 

PG: You must reflect critically on your presence within the design and evaluation process.

**Note: This assignment specification hasn't been released yet. More details will be available after the due date of the previous assignment.**



<!-- 
Something like:
- take an existing product or system that helps people to complete a task
- create a prototype that uses a different interface to solve the same problem.
- evaluate your prototype with 3--5 other students from the class.
