## Description {#description}

Assignment 2 involves conducting a small-scale user research study involving an existing interface or interactive system. The research challenge is as follows:

> **AI Interface Usability:** [Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman) just called and it turns out that he, and the rest of the AI boom CEOs have been reading about something called "usability" and "user experience". They are now very concerned that AI-integrated technology may not be as usable as previously thought. They need the results of a pilot study pronto and you're the HCI researcher to run it. Your challenge is choose **one existing AI-integrated interactive computer system or interface** and run a user research study with 3--5 participants. 
> You will formulate a research question, collect and analyse data, and present research findings. Your study should involve at least one form of quantitative and one form of qualitative data and analysis.

When forming a research question, you might consider the user's mental model of the AI system, how the AI-integration helps or hinders the user, how AI-sourced errors or misunderstandings may occur. Other research focus areas are possible but these ones should help get you started.

Your study documentation will include research question, research plan, collected data, analysis, results, and conclusions under the following headings:

1. **Interface and Research Question**: explain the interface you are studying and the research question you pose.
2. **Research Plan** explain your study plan including data gathering strategies and analysis framework(s).
3. **Results:** present your quantitative and qualitative results, include excerpts from data, plots, tables, or other presentation approaches to help articulate your results.
4. **Discussion and Conclusions:** present your research findings how they might answer (or not answer) your research question, present any limitations or reflections on your chosen interface and research data.

You should include all collected data from your study in the `materials` folder of the GitLab template, and you may refer to it from your main research document.

To accomplish this task, you will need to have a strong understanding of _data gathering_, _quantitative analysis_, and _qualitative analysis_ as discussed in weeks 5-8 of the course. Your submission must demonstrate sophisticated engagement with these concepts.

## Specification {#specification}

Your submission must:

- include statement and justification of a research question
- include a clear research plan
- include data from 3--5 participants
- include results based on quantitative and qualitative data and analysis techniques
- include research findings and discussion
- include at least two references to external sources in ACM format
- be written in markdown format
- be a maximum of 1800 words + 10% acceptable buffer (i.e., no more than 1980 words)
- must be uploaded to _your fork_ of the [`comp3900-2025-user-research`](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp3900/2025/comp3900-2025-user-research) repository on Gitlab by the due date

## Submission Process {#submission-process}

1. Fork the template repository.
2. Follow appropriate data gathering and analysis processes to address the research challenge.
3. Upload research data and analysis scripts as well as other relevant materials in _your fork_ of the template repository.
4. Write your study documentation following the template in the repository.
5. Don't forget to include at least two references to external sources in ACM format in your documentation.

## Notes {#notes}

- Don't forget to ask for help or advice on the course forum: [Edstem discussions](https://edstem.org/au/courses/24905/discussion)
- Generative AI is not banned in this course, but written work is expected to be primarily your own work. Any use of generative AI must be cited including the scope to which it is applied. Use of generative AI without appropriate explanation and referencing comes under the _N_ category in the marking rubric.
- Note that it is allowed to use generative AI to help with aspects of data analysis (see Charles' lectures!) but you are responsible for the output and whether findings are justified or not, we may re-run analyses to check your data.
