# Course Lectures and Assessment for HCI Thirty-Nine-Hundred

Lecture sides and course activities for a course in human computer interaction.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:

1. Explain and illustrate key aspects of human-computer interaction.
2. Apply multiple perspectives, theories, and ethical and inclusive considerations in critiquing technologies and prototyping and developing new design ideas.
3. Investigate activities, practices, and contexts of technology use through contextual research methods.
4. Critically evaluate novel technology design ideas based on Human-Computer Interaction approaches.
5. (PG): Critically reflect on a designer’s own presence and influence within a technology design process.
