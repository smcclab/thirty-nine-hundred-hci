We are using Gitlab and Markdown to submit assignments in this course.

These two technologies are not very hard to use, but, if you are new to computing, all the new technology platforms can feel overwhelming.

You may find the resources on this page helpful, and if you have any further issues with Gitlab or Markdown, please ask questions on the course forum so that we can help.

## GitLab {#gitlab}

- ANU Teaching GitLab Server: <https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au>
- Missing Manual for ANU GitLab and Git: <https://comp.anu.edu.au/docs/gitlab/>

### Tips

## Markdown {#markdown}

- The Markdown Guide: <https://www.markdownguide.org>

### Tips

- To see expected formatting, look at Charles' example repo: <https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u4110680/comp3900-2025-prototyping>
- Use empty lines around headings, lists, and code blocks
- Use empty lines between images
- Use descriptive alt text/caption for images.
- To view the markdown preview, push your markdown to GitLab, view the `.md` file in the gitlab web interface, make sure "Preview" is selected.
- Please make sure URLs in your portfolio have angle brackets around them:
  `<http://example.com>` so that they work properly as links and in the PDF output.
- **Output PDF**: images may move from where they are declared due to the software used to generate the PDF ([pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)). This is typical for PDF files generated using LaTeX.
- **Output PDF**: images may take up a lot of space on the page, you can adjust the width of an image like so:

```
![Image caption here](path/to/image.jpg){width=50%}
```


## Google Colab {#colab}
