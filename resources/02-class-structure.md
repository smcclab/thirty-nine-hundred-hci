This course will provide an overview of the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and will introduce students to key interaction and experience design paradigms, approaches and methods. The course will equip students with theory, methods, and techniques to investigate different design situations, develop and prototype novel design ideas, and engage with the ethical dimensions of technology design.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:

1.  Explain and illustrate key aspects of human-computer interaction.
2.  Apply multiple perspectives, theories, and ethical and inclusive considerations in critiquing technologies and prototyping and developing new design ideas.
3.  Investigate activities, practices, and contexts of technology use through contextual research methods.
4.  Critically evaluate novel technology design ideas based on Human-Computer Interaction approaches.
5.  (PG): Critically reflect on a designer’s own presence and influence within a technology design process.

## Indicative Assessment

1.  Project Work One (20) \[LO 1,2\]
2.  Project Work Two (20) \[LO 1,2\]
3.  Project Proposal (20) \[LO 3,4\]e
4.  Prototype Design and Research Presentation (40) \[LO 2,3,4\]
    

## Assessments

### Pre-class and In-class tasks

Pre-class and In-class tasks are due in each tutorial.

The pre-class task includes a weekly post on the course forum (100-200 words) which will be discussed and developed during class.

In-class tasks are the main content of the tutorials which include conceptualising and discussing HCI topics, experimenting with prototyping and research methods, and collaborating with other students to develop and evaluate interactive system designs. 

Late submission is not permitted.

#### Rubric

- 0: did not attend class, or attended with pre- or in-class tasks not completed to a satisfactory standard.
- 0.25: attended and attempted one task to a satisfactory or good standard.
- 0.5: attended and attempted both tasks to a satisfactory or good standard.
- 0.75: attended and completed both tasks with at least one at a very good or excellent standard.
- 1.0: attended and completed both tasks to a very good or excellent standard.

### Assignment 1: Prototyping

Assignment 1 involves creating a prototype that solves a problem. 

Your prototype should engage with an interaction design challenge and consider multiple perspectives.

Your submission will include your prototype materials and documentation as well as a written design rationale.

See the course website for detailed specification and submission details. Your work should include at least two references. Late submission is not permitted. This is an individual assessment.

### Assignment 2: User Research

Assignment 2 involves conducting a small-scale user research study involving an existing interface or interactive system. 

You will formulate a research question, collect and analyse data, and present research findings.

Your study should involve  at least one form of quantitative and one form of qualitative data analysis.

Your submission will include your research question, research plan, collected data, analysis,  results, and conclusions.

See the course website for detailed specification and submission details. Your work should include at least five references. Late submission is not permitted. This is an individual assessment.

### Final Project: Prototype Design and Research Project

The final project involves a complete design and evaluation process for a prototype interactive system. 

You must design a prototype system in response to a real-world problem. You will evaluate this system and report on the results using HCI research methods.

Your work will be submitted as a portfolio including your prototype materials, research data, analysis, references, and a presentation.

The presentation should cover problem identification, design rationale, prototype demonstration, evaluation methodology, and results. 

PG: You must reflect critically on your presence within the design process.

See the course website for detailed specification and submission details. Your work should include at least five references. Late submission is not permitted. This is an individual assessment.
