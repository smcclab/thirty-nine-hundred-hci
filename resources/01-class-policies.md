## Code of conduct {#code-of-conduct}

Everyone in this course is responsible for:

- Promoting an inclusive, collaborative learning environment.
- Taking action when others do not.

**We reject behaviour that strays into harassment, no matter how mild.**
Harassment refers to offensive verbal or written comments in reference to
gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion;
sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography  or recording, sustained disruption of class meetings,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If you feel someone is violating these principles (for example, with a joke
that could be interpreted as sexist, racist, or exclusionary), **it is your
responsibility to speak up!** If the behaviour persists, send a private message
to your course convener to explain the situation. We will preserve your
anonymity[^1].

Note that you are also bound by the [ANU Student Code of
Conduct](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/student-code-of-conduct)
during your time as an ANU student, in particular students are expected to:

> actively participate in learning activities including all class time,
> independent learning and assessments, and strive to seek depth, breadth and
> challenge in their learning;

[^1]: This code of conduct was adapted from the COMP1110 Code of Conduct, and originally developed by Evan Peck of Bucknell University. Portions of this code of conduct are adapted from Dr. Lorena A. Barba


## Attendance {#attendance}

This course is designed for in-person delivery only due to the interactive
nature of lectures and collaborative workshops. Remote participation is not
supported in this course. Students are expected to have **full attendence** at all
learning activities (lectures, workshops, concerts).

If you have any reason that you cannot attend a certain activity, you must
[communicate](#communication) this with your tutor well in advance. If you cannot attend campus
due to illness but are able to work from home, you may be able to have limited participation in workshops and collaborate  using the [course forum](#communication).

If you have accessibility issues that impact your attendance or ability to access the learning activities, you **must** discuss this with the course convenor at the start of the course or as soon as these issues are known.


## Communication {#communication}

Any communication in this course will happen over one of two channels:

1. your student email account
2. the [course forum](https://edstem.org/au/courses/24905/discussion) (you will be added to this in this in week 1)

If you need to ask a question about the course, here's how to do it:

- Ask on the forum, and any of the course staff or students will be able to help you.
- Use public posts, not direct messages. If you need to get a particular person's attention, `@` them in the main chat.
- If you need help with a software problem, any assessment item, or just want to vent about writing loops in Pd, post on the forum.
- Extensions are handled through a special website, see below.
- If you need to get in touch with the course convenor directly to discuss a private matter (and it really is private): firstname.lastname@anu.edu.au
- Disrespectful, harassing, or discriminatory posting or messaging this course is **not acceptable** and will not be tolerated (see the code of conduct).

Please not that the course staff are not likely to respond to messages or
emails outside of ANU working hours or if they are on leave. Posting on the
[forum](#communication) is the best way to get an answer from any available staff member.

## Late Submissions {#late-submission}

Late submissions for assessment tasks are not accepted without an extension.

## Word limits {#word-limits}

Max word count limits are provided for the written assessment tasks in this
course and we expect you to stay within those limits. You won't lose marks
until you exceed a word limit by more than 10%

## Extensions {#extensions}

<a class="button--outline" href="https://quicklink.anu.edu.au/101o">Link to the Assessment Adjustment Form</a>

If you have any issues that would prevent you handing in work on time, please
use the [Assessment Adjustment Form](https://quicklink.anu.edu.au/101o).

- **In most cases it is easy to arrange a short extension**.

The [Assessment Adjustment Form](https://quicklink.anu.edu.au/101o) has built in instructions to help you provide correct information.
You will be asked to include your student number (UID), a short statement of
your situation and when you think you can get the work completed.

In the first instance, you do not need to provide documentation (e.g., a medical
certificate or educational access plan), as this is **not required for a short
extension**, but we may ask for it in some instances.

Note that: 

- If you receive an extension you may not receive feedback on your work at the same time as other students.
- We do not process extensions every day, but will attend to your request within a few days. Do not send multiple messages.
- Extensions of more than two weeks are not generally granted except in exceptional circumstances.

## Extenuating Circumstances Application {#eca}

<a class="button--outline" href="https://quicklink.anu.edu.au/101o">Link to the Assessment Adjustment Form</a>

If you have any unexpected and unavoidable issues that has affected your
performance in the course (e.g., sickness, hardship or essential duties during assessment tasks), please think about applying for 
adjustment due to [extenuating circumstances
(use the Assessment Adjustment Form)](#eca) to document your issue.

- The [Assessment Adjustment form](#eca) can help you figure out whether to apply for an **extension** or **extenuating circumstances**. For short extensions on non-exams, it's almost always better to apply for an extension.

If you have a serious, unexpected, and unavoidable issue on the day of an exam
which means you can't do the exam on that day, please apply for [Extenuating
Circumstances (link)](#eca).

## Appeals {#appeals}

From the date that your marks for any assessment item are released
electronically you have a period of 10 working days in which to make an **informal
appeal** of your mark to the course convenor.

An **informal appeal** requires some explanation about why the original mark was
not correct (e.g., the marker accidentally missed a section of your
assignment).

You should submit an informal appeal in a private message to the course convenor by email. Please include your student number (UID), a short statement
of why you think your mark was not correct referring to the marking criteria
for the assignment.

If an informal appeal is denied by the course convenor, you may still make a
formal appeal. This requires a convincing statement that your mark was
incorrect given the stated marking criteria and assessment instructions. For
the formal appeal procedure see the information
[here](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/assessment-appeals).

## Supplementary assessment {#supplementary-assessment}

If you receive a PX grade you are eligible for supplementary assessment. The
assessment item may be an assignment, a written exam, an oral exam, or another form of in-person assessment. To pass
this assessment item, you must demonstrate a "good" attainment of the learning
outcomes, generally equivalent to a mark of 60/100.

## Academic integrity {#academic-integrity}

At the ANU [we take academic integrity seriously](http://academichonesty.anu.edu.au/). 
In this course, all the ANU academic integrity principles apply.

In particular:

> All ideas, code and content that is not created by you must be referenced.

You _are allowed_ to include material in your assignments from others where it
fits with the specification, but you _must not_ pretend that you created it.
See the ANU's [academic integrity best practices for
learners](https://services.anu.edu.au/learning-teaching/academic-integrity/academic-integrity-best-practice-principles-for-learners)
to understand more.

In this course we aim for a strong culture of collaborative learning on all
assessment tasks, but you are assessed on your individual contribution.
Referencing work that you have (legally) adapted from online sources or from a
colleague is a basic act of respect in a network of peers.

As a basic measure, we expect everyone to have at least two references in each
assessment showing that you are aware of how to work
independently in a studio environment and acknowledge sources.

If you act against the principles of academic integrity in this course, it's
very likely you'll get caught. At a minimum, this will delay your feedback for
an assignment. It might delay your completion of the course (and your graduation), 
and could have very serious consequences for your enrolment at ANU in serious cases.
