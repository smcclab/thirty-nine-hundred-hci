**Interviewer:** Thanks for participating today, David. I'd like you to walk me through how you typically order groceries on your phone. Can you start by showing me what you usually do?

**David:** Sure, no problem. So I mainly use the Woolworths app... let me pull it up here. *[opens phone, scrolls through home screen]* Okay, sometimes it takes me a moment to find it because I have so many apps. There it is.

**Interviewer:** What made you choose Woolworths over other options?

**David:** Honestly, it was just the first one I tried when COVID started. My partner usually does the shopping, but when we couldn't go out as much, I had to figure this out. *[app is loading]* Come on... the loading time is pretty annoying sometimes, especially when I'm trying to do this quickly during lunch breaks.

**Interviewer:** Tell me what you're doing now.

**David:** Okay, so it's asking for my location again. I swear I do this every time. *[taps "Allow location"]* I wish it would just remember... Alright, now I can see the main screen. I usually start with the search because I have a pretty good idea of what I need.

*[starts typing]*

**David:** I'm searching for "bread" first. *[types on screen]* Oh, this is one thing that bugs me - the keyboard covers half the screen, so I can't see the suggestions properly. And sometimes the autocomplete is weird... like, I'll type "tom" for tomatoes and it suggests "Tommy's snacks" or something random.

**Interviewer:** How do you typically plan what to buy?

**David:** Well, that's actually a bit chaotic. *[laughs]* My partner usually keeps a shopping list on the fridge, but then I forget to bring it or take a photo. So I end up trying to remember while I'm doing this. Sometimes I'll text her while I'm ordering, like "Do we need milk?" 

*[selects bread from search results]*

**David:** See, now I have to choose between like 15 different types of bread. This part is overwhelming. At the actual store, I just grab our usual one, but here I have to scroll through all these options. *[scrolls through bread options]* I usually just go with what looks familiar or has good ratings.

**Interviewer:** What happens next?

**David:** *[adds bread to cart]* Okay, added. Now I need... let me think... milk, eggs, something for Emma's lunch box. *[navigating back to search]* This is where I sometimes get frustrated - when I want to add multiple items, I have to keep going back and searching again. I wish there was a way to add several things to a list first, then review everything.

*[searches for "milk"]*

**David:** Alright, milk. Same issue here - too many choices. Do we want full cream? Lite? The organic one? *[scrolls]* I usually just get whatever's cheapest unless I remember my partner specifically mentioning a brand.

**Interviewer:** Do you ever have issues finding specific items?

**David:** Oh yeah, all the time. Like, Emma loves these specific fruit pouches, but they're never where I expect them to be. If I search "fruit pouch" I get like protein bars and random stuff. I have to search "kids snacks" or browse through the baby section. It's not intuitive.

*[continues adding items]*

**David:** *[looking at cart]* Wait, let me check my cart... *[taps cart icon]* Okay, I've got bread, milk... Oh, this is annoying - it shows me the total but not the individual prices clearly. Sometimes I want to know if I'm getting a good deal, but I have to tap on each item separately.

**Interviewer:** How do you handle quantities?

**David:** That's actually pretty easy once you know where to look. *[demonstrates]* See these little plus and minus buttons? Though I did accidentally order 10 loaves of bread once when Emma was "helping" me. *[laughs]* The app should probably have some kind of "Are you sure?" for unusual quantities.

**Interviewer:** What about the checkout process?

**David:** *[navigates to checkout]* Right, so this part is usually okay. I have my card saved, which is convenient. But choosing the delivery time is sometimes stressful. *[shows delivery slots]* Like right now, I can see there are no slots tomorrow, and the day after only has early morning or late evening. With Emma's schedule, that's tricky.

**Interviewer:** Do you use any special features?

**David:** I tried the "previous orders" thing, which is helpful. *[navigates to order history]* But it shows me everything I've ever ordered, not just the regular stuff. I wish it could learn what I buy weekly versus one-off items. Like, I don't need to see that Easter chocolate I bought six months ago.

**Interviewer:** Any other frustrations or things that work well?

**David:** The photos are really helpful - sometimes the product names are confusing, but if I can see it, I know if it's right. But the app crashes sometimes, usually when I have a full cart, which is super frustrating. I've lost my whole order before and had to start over.

The substitution thing is weird too. Like, they'll substitute my regular bread with some artisanal sourdough that costs three times as much, but they won't tell me the price difference upfront.

**Interviewer:** How long does this whole process usually take you?

**David:** For a weekly shop? Maybe 20-30 minutes if everything goes smoothly. But if the app is being slow, or if I'm trying to remember what we need, it can take much longer. Sometimes I just give up and drive to the store instead.

**Interviewer:** Overall, how would you rate the experience?

**David:** It's... functional? Like, it gets the job done, but it feels like it was designed by people who don't actually do grocery shopping with kids and busy schedules. It works best when I know exactly what I want, but real life isn't always that organized, you know?

**Interviewer notes:**
- User shows adaptation strategies (texting partner, using photos of shopping lists)
- Clear pain points around search functionality and navigation
- Quantity selection UX issue (accidental large orders)
- Delivery scheduling constraints affect user behavior
- App crashes cause significant frustration due to lost progress
- Information architecture doesn't match user mental models (fruit pouches example)
- Price transparency issues
- Personalization features exist but aren't effectively implemented
