## How are HCI paper usually structured?

- Introduction
- Related work/literature review
- Methodology and methods
- Study design
- Findings (e.g., themes, design implications)
- Discussion
- Conclusions
- Limitations and future work


## What makes HCI different from other fields of computing?

- addresses a broad range of technology users, interfaces, and methods
- publications can focus on interaction and experience design as well/instead of specifics of implementation
- qualitative and quantitative research methods
- often involves human research through evaluating technologies with people
- different kinds of contributions that HCI research can make: (1)  _empirical_ , (2)  _artifact_ , (3)  _methodological_ , (4)  _theoretical_ , (5)  _benchmark / dataset_ , (6)  _survey_ , and (7)  _opinion_ .  [@wobbrock-contributions-HCI]
