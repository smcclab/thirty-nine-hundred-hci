title: Design Sustainability
author: Dr Jennyfer Lawrence Taylor
---


The purpose of this tutorial is to help you think through the
environmental dimensions of technology design and use, and how to
prototype new technology designs in sustainable ways.

## Pre-Class Tasks

You should complete the following activities prior to attending your
tutorial:

- Watch the Week 10 lecture content on HCI and sustainability (if
  possible before your tutorial) and review the lecture slides

- Develop a plan for how you are going to construct your high-fidelity
  prototype.


## Plan for the Class


The tutorial will follow this structure:

1.  Introduction and announcements (5 mins)
2.  Materials and tools analysis of your design process (25 mins)
3.  Reporting back and discussion (10 mins)

## In-Class Tasks

### Materials and tools analysis of your design process (25 mins)

Create a shared document for your group with the following table:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Number**   **Material/Tool**   **Artefact          **Environmental
                                  produced**          impacts of the
                                                      material/tool**
------------ ------------------- ------------------- ---------------------
*1*          *e.g., Draw.io*     *Brainstorming      *C02 emissions, water
                                  diagram*            use, energy use from
                                                      cloud computing
                                                      infrastructure (try
                                                      to include more
                                                      specifics and detail
                                                      than this)*

2                                                    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Discuss the following points below and populate the table cells with your responses:

- **Materials/tools:** List all of the materials and tools that you
  have used in your Prototype Design and Presentation Assessment so
  far (hardware, software, devices, digital files, note paper,
  stationery, crafting materials).

- **Artefact produced:** Identify the artefact(s) that you produced
  using these tools (e.g., planning documents, ideation materials,
  prototypes etc.)

- **Environmental impact:** Think about the environmental impact of
  the materials and tools that you have used (including the
  infrastructure needed to produce the materials or offer the
  services). What alternative materials/tools could you use that
  would reduce the environmental impact of your design work
  (thinking about energy, waste etc.)?

> You may need to do some internet research as part of this activity.
> Try to include specifics and examples as much as possible e.g., amount
> of emissions, resources used etc.


### Add the following additional columns to your table:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Lifespan**   **Value**             **Reuse/repurpose   **Possible
                                      of artefacts**      alternative
                                                          materials**

                sessions and in                           
                producing high                            
                quality                                   
                visualisations.                           

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Discuss the following points below and populate the table cells with your responses

- **Lifespan:** Think about think the intended lifespan of each
  artefact until it stops becoming useful (e.g., three weeks, six
  months, five years). How will you use, store, or dispose of this
  artefact after its intended lifespan?

- **Value:** For each of physical and digital artefact you have
  identified, what kinds of value do these artefacts hold, if any
  (apart from providing you with a grade in the course)? Will the
  artefacts or knowledge encoded in them have value for your studies
  and career beyond the course? Will any of these artefacts have
  sentimental or emotional value?

- **Reuse/repurposing:** Can any of the artefacts you have produced
  or their materials be reused or repurposed for something else
  after the course?

- **Possible tools/alternative materials:**

  - Identify 5 items of household waste that each person in the
    group commonly throws away (e.g., tin foil, yoghurt containers,
    cardboard cereal boxes, brown butchers/deli paper, egg cartons,
    toilet roll tubes).

  - Think about the material properties of these waste items as
    possible resources for prototyping (what they are made from, the
    look and feel, mechanical properties, how to dispose of the
    material, safe handling of the material):

  - Discuss whether any of the items you have identified could serve
    as alternatives to the materials and tools you have identified
    above.
