## Contextual Factors

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

Think about the setting and context in which interaction takes place:

- Who, what, when, where, why, how of your activity
- How technology extends spatial and temporal dimensions
- What the explicit and unwritten rules, norms, conventions, practices are
- How people interact with tools, technologies, and their environment
- How the setting shape the activity and outputs – “situated actions and practices” [@suchman:1987]

# Conceptual Design

- Developing a Conceptual Model
- An outline of what people can do and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact
- Need to understand the problem space and users
- Generate ideas based on understanding

## Conceptual Model

- Metaphor, analogies, concepts, relationships, mappings
- How to choose  __interface metaphors__ that will help users understand the product?
- Which  __interaction types__ would best support the users’ activities?
- Do different  __interface types__ suggest alternative design insights or options?

## Interface Metaphors

Choosing metaphors [@erickson-metaphors:1995]

1. Identify functional requirements (what it will do)
2. Which parts are likely to cause users problems?
3. Generate metaphors

Evaluate metaphors: Structure, Relevance, Representation, Understandable, Extensible (Sharp et al., p. 440-441 for example)

## Interaction Types

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
Instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring, responding

- Which is best, depends on the design
- Most models will include a combination
- Different parts will have different types

## Interface Types

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Prompt and support different user experiences / behaviour
- Prototyping will require an interface type or candidates
- Depends on product constraints from requirements
- Input and output modes <- user/context requirements
