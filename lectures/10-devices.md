**Who has a question?**

- I can take _cathchbox_ question up until 2:55
- For after class questions: meet me outside the classroom at the bar (for 30 minutes)
- Feel free to ask about **any aspect of the course**
- Also feel free to ask about **any aspect of computing at ANU**! I may not be able to help, but I can listen.
