## Cognitive processes

Cognitive processes can change depending on the problem:

- __Experiential Cognition__: 2 + 2 =
- __Reflective Cognition__: 21 x 19 =

## What are cognitive processes?

Processes of Cognition (Eysenck and Brysbaert 2018)

1. Attention
2. Perception
3. Memory
4. Learning
5. Reading, speaking, listening
6. Problem solving, planning, reasoning, decision making

## 1. Attention

- “It involves selecting things on which to concentrate, at a point in time, from a range of the possibilities available, allowing us to focus on information that is relevant to what we are doing.” (Sharp et al. 2019, p. 103)
    - Clear goals (directed searching vs browsing)
    - Information presentation (structure and layout in the interface)
    - Multitasking and attention
      - Depends on individuals and context
      - Relevance of distractions
      - Effort to task switch
      - Designing to support effective multitasking

## 1. Attention

![(Sharp et al. 2019, p.108)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_4.png)

## 2. Perception

- “[…] how information is acquired from the environment via the five sense organs (vision, hearing, taste, smell, and touch) and transformed into experiences of objects, events, senses, and tastes” (Roth, 1986 in Sharp et al. 2019, p. 109)
- Proprioception: Awareness of position and movement of body through muscles and joints
- Vision -> hearing -> touch (sighted individuals)

![(Image: Sharp et al. 2019, p.109)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_6.png)

## 2. Perception

![(Sharp et al. 2019, p.109)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_7.png)

## 3. Memory

> “Memory involves recalling various kinds of knowledge that allow people to act appropriately. ” (Sharp et al. 2019, p. 111)

- Brain filters what to remember and what to forget to avoid overload – but not always in the way we want to!
- Filtering into memory – depends on encoding process (e.g., active vs passive learning) and context (e.g., seeing someone in a different context)
- People are better at recognition than recall
- Relying on technology rather than memory (e.g., car navigation system, “let me Google that…”)
- Personal information management – folder scanning and search engines
- Remembering passwords and multifactor authentication

## 3. Memory

![](img/02_theory_and_concepts_9.png)

(Sharp et al. 2019, p.119)

## 4. Learning

> “accumulation of skills and knowledge that would be impossible to achieve without memory” (Sharp et al. 2019 p.119)

- Incidental learning vs intentional learning
- Learning by reading vs learning by doing
- Learning through collaboration
- Micro-learning
- Multimodal learning through new and emerging technologies e.g., Augmented reality and virtual reality

![(Hooper et al. 2012)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_10.jpg)
![(Cheng et al. 2017)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_11.jpg)

## 5. Reading, Speaking, Listening

- Communication skills
- Meaning the same across modes
- Writing – permanent, speaking = transient
- Reading quicker than listening
- Listening less cognitive effort than reading
- Some more grammatical than others
- Interactive books, speech technologies, natural language processing, tactile interfaces, assistive technologies

## 5. Learning and Communication Design Implications

![(Sharp et al. 2019, p.119)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_14.png)
![(Sharp et al. 2019, p.121)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_15.png)

## 6. Problem- Solving, Planning, Reasoning, Decision-Making

- Involve “reflective cognition” in relation to actions, choices, consequences

How do you make purchasing decisions? What role does technology play?
![(Sharp et al. 2019, p.122)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_16.png)

# Cognitive Frameworks

- Mental models
- __Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation__
- Information Processing
- __Distributed Cognition__
- __External Cognition__
- Embodied Interaction

## Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation (Don Norman)

![](img/02_theory_and_concepts_17.png)
![](img/02_theory_and_concepts_18.png)
![](img/02_theory_and_concepts_19.png)

[The two UX Gulfs: Evaluation and Execution](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-ux-gulfs-evaluation-execution/)

## External Cognition (Scaife and Rogers 1996 in Sharp et al. 2019)

- Internal representations (in the head) and external representations (artefacts in the world) and how they interact
- Combined with tools (e.g., pens, calculators, spreadsheets) to support cognitive activities
- External cognition: “the cognitive processes involved when we interact with different external representations” (Sharp et al. 2019, p.129)
- Reducing memory load, computational offloading, annotating, cognitive tracing

(Sharp et al. 2019, p.129)

## Distributed Cognition

- Also about interactions between people, artefacts, and internal and external representations
- Event-driven, systems as the unit of analysis, collective behaviours
- Information flows and transformations through the system
- Different levels of granularity
- Analysis addresses problem solving, communication (verbal and non-verbal), coordination mechanisms, accessing and sharing knowledge
- Analysis can inform design implications and decision-making in designing to support distributed cognition

(Sharp et al. 2019, p.120; Rogers 2012 pp.38-39)

# Social Interaction

> What are the kinds of situations in which you would phone someone?

> What are the kinds of situations in which you would send someone a text message?

## Face-to-Face Conversations

- Conversational rules from  __Conversational Analysis __ (Sacks 1987):
- Adjacency pairs – setting up an expectation of a response (Schegloff and Sacks 1973)
- Breakdowns and repairs: Breaking rules or missing cues
- Designing conversational user interfaces and to support face-to-face communication

![(Sharp et al. 2019, p.139-142)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_27.png)

- Collaborative activity involving social skills, rules, norms, and conventions
  - Often tacit – people are not actively aware of, or thinking about, following them
  - People have different communication styles, backgrounds, and abilities -  __inclusive design is important__
- Different ways of opening, maintaining, and closing a conversation – implicit and explicit rules

![](img/02_theory_and_concepts_28.png)

## Remote Conversations

Image: Susan Lechelt in Sharp et al. 2019, p.147, (Sharp et al. 2019, pp. 143-149)

- Phone to video conferencing
- "Telepresence”:  “The perception of being there while physically remote” (Sharp et al. 2019, p.144)
- Telepresence rooms, robots, virtual reality
- Features of interaction design can establish a sense of presence and facilitate remote conversation
- “Social presence”: “the feeling of being there with a real person in virtual reality” (p.146)

## Co-Presence

> “supporting people in their activities when they are interacting in the same physical space” (Sharp et al. 2019, p.150)

- Supporting effective collaboration
- Physical coordination– hand gestures, body language, use of objects such as wands and batons
- Awareness – knowing what is going on around you, functioning as “close-knit teams”
- Shareable interfaces e.g., whiteboards, touch screens
- Social translucence: “designing communication systems to enable participants and their activities to be visible to one another” (p.155)
- Lots of good examples in the textbook

## Social Engagement

- “Participation in the activities of a social group (Anderson and Binstock, 2012). Often involves some form of social exchange where people give and receive something from others […] voluntary and unpaid” (Sharp et al. 2019, p.158)
- Connecting people with a common interest – e.g., Twitter battles, viral posts. Digital volunteering – disaster information sharing, citizen science

# Emotional Interaction

![Pepper Robot (Photo by [Alex Knight](https://unsplash.com/@agk42)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_49.jpg)

## Three Levels of Emotion

![(in Sharp et al. 2019, p.171)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_50.png)

## Expressive Interfaces and Emotional Design

- Design features that seek to create an emotional connection with users or elicit emotional responses in users
- Denoting the system state
- Expressivity through animated icons, sonofications (sound effects), vibrotactile feedback (e.g., mobile phone or watch buzzing)
- Nice looking design affects people’s perceptions of the usability + they are pleasurable to use
- Annoying interfaces elicit negative emotional responses (e.g., unable to do the task, feeling patronised, unhelpful, time-consuming to use, intrusive, passive-aggressive)
- (in Sharp et al. 2019, p.172-178)

## Affective Computing

![[Rosalind Picard: Affective Computing, Engineering Emotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_86GQiEOjp4)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_54.png)

## Emotional AI

- Automating the measurement of feelings and behaviours by using AI technologies
- Various sensors and measures
- Six fundamental emotions classified by Affdex: Anger, contempt, disgust, fear, joy, sadness
- Applications such as improving driver safety (e.g., improving mood and concentration, detecting drowsiness)
- Eye-tracking, words and phrases, biometric data (e.g., heart rate)

![(Sharp et a;l. 2019, p.180)](img/02_theory_and_concepts_55.png)

## Contextual Factors

Think about the setting and context in which interaction takes place:

- Who, what, when, where, why, how of your activity
- How technology extends spatial and temporal dimensions
- What the explicit and unwritten rules, norms, conventions, practices are
- How people interact with tools, technologies, and their environment
- How the setting shape the activity and outputs – “situated actions and practices” (Suchman 1987)
