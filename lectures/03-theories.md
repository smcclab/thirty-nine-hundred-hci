## 1. Attention

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
“It involves selecting things on which to concentrate, at a point in time, from a range of the possibilities available, allowing us to focus on information that is relevant to what we are doing.” (@rogers-beyond-hci:2023 p. 103)

- Clear goals (directed searching vs browsing)
- Information presentation (structure and layout in the interface)
- Multitasking and attention
  - Depends on individuals and context
  - Relevance of distractions
  - Effort to task switch
  - Designing to support effective multitasking

## Design Implications for Attention

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

- consider context to make information salient when required
- techniques: animation, colour, ordering, spacing

## 2. Perception

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- “[…] how information is acquired from the environment via the five sense organs (vision, hearing, taste, smell, and touch) and transformed into experiences of objects, events, senses, and tastes” (Roth, 1986 in @rogers-beyond-hci:2023 p. 109)
- Proprioception: Awareness of position and movement of body through muscles and joints
- Vision -> hearing -> touch (sighted individuals)

::::::::::::::

## Design Implications for Perception

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- design icons and graphics to be distinguished
- white space and separators to group information
- sounds (earcons!) can help distinguish information
- colour contrast is important for perception (and accessibility)
- haptic feedback: use carefully, perhaps in response to user initiated actions

## 3. Memory

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
> “Memory involves recalling various kinds of knowledge that allow people to act appropriately. ” (@rogers-beyond-hci:2023 p. 111)

- Brain filters what to remember and what to forget to avoid overload – but not always in the way we want to!
- Filtering into memory – depends on encoding process (e.g., active vs passive learning) and context (e.g., seeing someone in a different context)
- People are better at recognition than recall
- Relying on technology rather than memory (e.g., car navigation system, “let me Google that…”)
- Personal information management – folder scanning and search engines
- Remembering passwords and multifactor authentication

# Sketching Design Ideas

![(@buxton-sketching:2007 p.104)](img/06_ideation_7.png)

- What is a sketch?
- What makes something a sketch?

## What is a sketch?

- Quick
- Timely
- Inexpensive
- Disposable
- Plentiful
- Clear vocabulary
- Distinct gesture
- Minimal detail
- Appropriate degree of refinement
- Suggest and explore rather than confirm
- Ambiguity

(@buxton-sketching:2007, p.111-113)

## What should a sketch include?

- Title
- Annotations
- Short description (1-2 sentences)

![Design Idea: An AR app on a mobile phone that allows mosaic makers to preview tiles before gluing. This can help to choose colours and preview placement and positioning before being fixed.
](img/06_ideation_8.png)

## Is a sketch a prototype?

No.

## How to choose your Best Ideas

- High-Fidelity Prototype – Design Idea EXCEPTIONAL
- Design idea is original, creative, and interesting.
- Connection to design opportunities identified in project 2 is clear and compelling.
- Design could be seamlessly used in the chosen activity in ways that enrich the making practice.

## Introduction

- Design, prototyping, construction - Design phase 
- Solutions are created, prototyped, tested, iterated

## Conceptual Design

- Developing a Conceptual Model
- An outline of what people can do and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact
- Need to understand the problem space and users
- Generate ideas based on understanding
- Explore ideas with tutorial groups

## Conceptual Model

- Metaphor, analogies, concepts, relationships, mappings
- How to choose  __interface metaphors__ that will help users understand the product?
- Which  __interaction types__ would best support the users’ activities?
- Do different  __interface types__ suggest alternative design insights or options?

## Interface Metaphors

Choosing metaphors [@erickson-metaphors:1995]

1. Identify functional requirements (what it will do)
2. Which parts are likely to cause users problems?
3. Generate metaphors

Evaluate metaphors: Structure, Relevance, Representation, Understandable, Extensible (Sharp et al., p. 440-441 for example)

## Interaction Types

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
Instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring, responding

- Which is best, depends on the design
- Most models will include a combination
- Different parts will have different types

## Interface Types

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Prompt and support different user experiences / behaviour
- Prototyping will require an interface type or candidates
- Depends on product constraints from requirements
- Input and output modes <- user/context requirements

## Take away messages

- Prototyping can serve many purposes in HCI research, and support different stages of the design process
- There is more than one way to prototype a single design concept (low fi and hi fi)
- Prototypes help you  __to learn __ about your users’ interactions and experiences with your design artifact
- Your choice of prototyping approach depends on what you are trying to learn and why
