# What is HCAI?

# HCAI frameworks

# Design Metaphor

<!-- INTRO / Overview -->
- Reflect on both science and innovation goals.
- Four pairs of design metaphors.
- Balance between automation and human control for reliability.

<!-- Notes for Charles -->
 <!-- key is to combine designs that take an automated approach for tasks that can be carried out reliably, and a user-controlled approach for tasks that users want to manage.
 <!--  -->

## History on Artificial Intelligence:  
<!-- can machines think? -->
<!--  a picture of turing test -->
- Charles briefly explains turing test.
- Computers to do what humans do, matching or exceeding human perceptual cognitive, and motor abilities. 
- Pattern recognition such as images, speech, MLP; robotics; emotion recognition; and games (e.g., Alpha Go).
- Statistical approach: GANs, CNN, RNN, and IRL. <!-- inverse reinforcement learning  -->
- Criticisms: brute-force computation; less successful knowledge-based expert systems over engineered rule-based systems; DL approaches.
- **AI is in its early days.**
- **Make AI products with more transparency and human control over the algorithms.**

## Science and Innovation Goals

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Understand human perceptual, cognitive, and motor abilities so as to build computers that perform tasks as well as or better than humans. 
    - social robots, common-sense reasoning, affective computers, machine consciousness, and artificial general intelligence (AGI).
- Develop widely-used products and services by applying HCAI methods.
    - supertools, telebots, etc.
<!-- Notes for Charles -->
<!-- Maybe you can discuss these two goals' differences.  More see Printed page 11 in green highlights.-->

## Questions: Who has a question?

**Who has a question?**

- I can take _cathchbox_ question up until 2:55
- For after class questions: meet me outside the classroom at the bar (for 30 minutes)
- Feel free to ask about **any aspect of the course**
- Also feel free to ask about **any aspect of computing at ANU**! I may not be able to help, but I can listen.
