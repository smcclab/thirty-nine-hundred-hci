# What is HCAI?

# HCAI frameworks

# Design Metaphor

<!-- INTRO / Overview -->
- Reflect on both science and innovation goals.
- Four pairs of design metaphors.
- Balance between automation and human control for reliability.

<!-- Notes for Charles -->
 <!-- key is to combine designs that take an automated approach for tasks that can be carried out reliably, and a user-controlled approach for tasks that users want to manage.
 <!--  -->

## History on Artificial Intelligence:  
<!-- can machines think? -->
<!--  a picture of turing test -->
- Charles briefly explains turing test.
- Computers to do what humans do, matching or exceeding human perceptual cognitive, and motor abilities. 
- Pattern recognition such as images, speech, MLP; robotics; emotion recognition; and games (e.g., Alpha Go).
- Statistical approach: GANs, CNN, RNN, and IRL. <!-- inverse reinforcement learning  -->
- Criticisms: brute-force computation; less successful knowledge-based expert systems over engineered rule-based systems; DL approaches.
- **AI is in its early days.**
- **Make AI products with more transparency and human control over the algorithms.**

## Science and Innovation Goals

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Understand human perceptual, cognitive, and motor abilities so as to build computers that perform tasks as well as or better than humans. 
    - social robots, common-sense reasoning, affective computers, machine consciousness, and artificial general intelligence (AGI).
- Develop widely-used products and services by applying HCAI methods.
    - supertools, telebots, etc.
<!-- Notes for Charles -->
<!-- Maybe you can discuss these two goals' differences.  More see Printed page 11 in green highlights.-->

## Science and Innovation Goals

Autonomous social robots

- Science goals: a general purpose robot elders, parcel delivery, etc.
- Innovation goals: tune solution for each context of use.
<!-- Notes for Charles -->
<!-- More see Printed page 11 in yellow highlights; just think it's good to discuss an example.-->

Online meeting services

- Science: devices / software support collaboration.
- Innovation: Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google meet.

## Intelligent Agents and Supertools
Early Perceptions of Computers

- 1940s‚Äì1950s: Computers were labeled "awesome thinking machines" and "electronic brains".
- Dianne Martin: Argues that such myths slowed workplace acceptance and created unrealistic expectations[@martin1933myth].
- Alan Turing (1950):
    - Introduced "Can Machines Think?" [@turing1950computing].
    - Proposed the Turing Test (aka the imitation game).
    - Envisioned machines competing with humans in intellectual fields.
- Debate: a deceptive metaphor rather than a meaningful test[@natale2021deceitful].

## Intelligent Agents and Supertools
Human‚ÄìComputer Symbiosis (1960)[@licklider1960man]

- Computers and humans as collaborative partners.
- Humans make decisions; computers handle routine tasks.

AI Language & Metaphors

- Terms like smart, intelligent, thinking have influenced public perception.
- AI described using neuroscience metaphors (e.g., neural networks).
- IBM Watson: Marketed under "cognitive computing", later shifted to "augmented intelligence" for clarity.
- Google PAIR: Focus on People and AI Research, emphasising human-centered design.

## Intelligent Agents and Supertools
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Media & Popular Culture Influences

- Journalists & magazines (e.g., Newsweek, Time) popularised ideas of thinking machines and robots replacing jobs.
- Graphic art & Hollywood films (e.g., 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, Her, Ex Machina) reinforced human-like AI images.

Human-Centered Perspectives

- Portrayed as independent actors or agents that (‚Äúwho‚Äù).
- Warn again terms such as know, read, explain, but to **empower**, not replace humans[@rusdaniela2020].

## Intelligent Agents and Supertools
Human‚ÄìAI Design Debate: automation vs direct user control [ref]
<!-- - Shneiderman: Emphasised user control via direct manipulation (buttons, sliders, etc.).
- Maes: Advocated for proactive software agents that anticipate user needs. -->

Industry Design Guidelines on user control, flexibility, accessibility.
<!-- Guidelines from Apple, IBM, Microsoft: -->
<!-- User Control: ‚ÄúPeople‚Äînot apps‚Äîare in control.‚Äù
Flexibility: Users need fine-grained control.
Accessibility success story: A blind woman using a laptop to do professional work on a flight. -->

AI in Conferences & Applications:

- Science Goal (AI researchers): Automated performance (e.g., self-driving cars, reading x-rays).
- Innovation Goal (HCAI researchers): Promote human-supervised tools (e.g., SIGCHI, UXPA, Augmented Humans conferences) such as digital cameras.

> Combine intelligent agents with human-controlled tools to ensure trust, usability, and control


## Teammates and Tele-bots

## Assured Autonomy and Control Centers

## Social Robots and Active Appliances

<!-- KEY TAKEAWAY -->



# Governing Structure

# Hwo do we (NIMEy/Creative Computing) approach HCAI?



## Questions: Who has a question?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

**Who has a question?**

- I can take _cathchbox_ question up until 2:55
- For after class questions: meet me outside the classroom at the bar (for 30 minutes)
- Feel free to ask about **any aspect of the course**
- Also feel free to ask about **any aspect of computing at ANU**! I may not be able to help, but I can listen.
