## Final Project Research Challenge

> **Sustainable living through technology**: You woke up this morning, checked your email, and found that you have a new job---_ANU Student Lead for Sustainable Living_! 

> Your challenge is to help university students adopt sustainable behaviours in their everyday lives guided by the [UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) which call for urgent action on climate change, responsible consumption, and sustainable communities. 

> You will need to _choose a focus_ (e.g., energy use, waste reduction, transportation, consumption), _prototype_ and _evaluate_ an interface to make sustainable living more accessible, engaging or effective. Your system should involve a level of non-standard interaction, either through unusual use of standard computer IO hardware, or a novel interface. 

## Final Project Specification

- include documentation of a testable prototype, research question, evaluation plan, data collection, data analysis, and articulation of findings
- include a **video recording** of a presentation which follows the provided headings: `project-presentation.mp4`
- include documentation in `project-documentation.md` which follows the provided headings (**N.B.:** this text may be a transcript of your spoken presentation with references and images, it may also be a slightly different text.)

## Final Project Sections

Your presentation and documentation will have the following sections:

1. **Research Question, Plan, and Conclusions**

2. **Prototype Design and Features**

3. **Research Data, Analysis and Findings**: N.B. you can choose to collect either qualitative, quantitative, or both

4. **COMP6390 Only---Positionality Statement**: critically reflect on your presence and influence within the technology design process in a [statement of positionality](https://smcclab.github.io/thirty-nine-hundred-hci/lectures/06-reflexive-thematic-analysis.html#/reflexivity).

## Video Presentation

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- clear and concise covering the section headings above
- understandable audio **spoken by you**
- must include **video of your face** while presenting in the presentation
- must include at least 5 but no more than 10 slides
- title slides, personal introductions, tables of contents, reference slides are **not required** (waste of time!)

## Cognition

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
A definition from Oxford English Dictionary:

> The action or faculty of knowing taken in its widest sense, including sensation, perception, conception, etc., as distinguished from feeling and volition...

## Cognitive processes

Cognitive processes can change depending on the problem:

- __Experiential Cognition__: 2 + 2 =
- __Reflective Cognition__: 21 x 19 =

## What are cognitive processes?

::: {.column width="60%"}
1. Attention
2. Perception
3. Memory
4. Learning
5. Reading, speaking, listening
6. Problem solving, planning, reasoning, decision making

## 1. Attention

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Selecting things to focus on, relevant to our needs,  from possibilities.

- clear goals (directed searching vs browsing)
- information presentation (structure and layout in the interface)
- multitasking and attention
  - depends on individuals and context
  - relevance of distractions
  - effort to task switch
  - designing to support effective multitasking

## Design Implications for Perception

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

## 3. Memory

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

- people are better at recognition than recall
- relying on technology rather than memory (e.g., car navigation system, “let's ask Claude..”)
- personal information management
- remembering passwords and multifactor authentication

# Social Interaction

## Activity: Social human computer interactions

- What are the kinds of situations in which you would phone someone?
- What are the kinds of situations in which you would send someone a text message?
- What leads to the difference?

Introduce yourself to someone nearby, talk for 2-3 minutes, and we'll hear some answers.

- How the setting shape the activity and outputs – “situated actions and practices” [@suchman:1987]

# Conceptual Design

- Developing a Conceptual Model
- An outline of what people can do and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact
- Need to understand the problem space and users
- Generate ideas based on understanding

## Conceptual Model

- Metaphor, analogies, concepts, relationships, mappings
- How to choose  __interface metaphors__ that will help users understand the product?
- Which  __interaction types__ would best support the users’ activities?
- Do different  __interface types__ suggest alternative design insights or options?

## Interface Metaphors

Choosing metaphors [@erickson-metaphors:1995]

1. Identify functional requirements (what it will do)
2. Which parts are likely to cause users problems?
3. Generate metaphors

Evaluate metaphors: Structure, Relevance, Representation, Understandable, Extensible (Sharp et al., p. 440-441 for example)

## Interaction Types

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
Instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring, responding

- Which is best, depends on the design
- Most models will include a combination
- Different parts will have different types

## Interface Types

- Prototyping will require an interface type or candidates
- Depends on product constraints from requirements
- Input and output modes <- user/context requirements

- For after class questions: meet me outside the classroom at the bar (for 30 minutes)
- Feel free to ask about **any aspect of the course**
- Also feel free to ask about **any aspect of computing at ANU**! I may not be able to help, but I can listen.
