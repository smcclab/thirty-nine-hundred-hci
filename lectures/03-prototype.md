## Announcements

- **Assignment updates**:
  - template repo is available
  - questions on the forum welcome, look in the "assignments" category.

Apology: I completely changed what I planned to do in this lecture. This will be more fun / relevant to the assignment.


## Plan for the class

- Sketch
- Prototype
- Make

## Making

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Last week I talked a bit about _identity_ in HCI.

My real identity here: _maker_. 

Making things to find out what, whether, how, and why.

Making as research methodology.

The framing this week around _sketches_ and _prototypes_ as different things with **rules** may not be something I agree with!

## Activity: Sketching toolkit?

What's your sketching toolkit?

## Charles sketching kit

- 2010-ish: Moleskine + biro
- 2013-ish: Moleskine cahier + biro
- 2016-ish: FIELD NOTES notebook + biro
- 2023: Traveler's Notebook + fountain pen (LAMY Safari + Pilot Ink)


## Is a sketch a prototype?

No.

## How to Choose your Best Ideas

## Ten Principles of Good Design

![[Dieter Rams (Video and Webpage)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/good-design)](img/06_ideation_11.jpg)

## How to choose your Best Ideas

- High-Fidelity Prototype – Design Idea EXCEPTIONAL
- Design idea is original, creative, and interesting.
- Connection to design opportunities identified in project 2 is clear and compelling.
- Design could be seamlessly used in the chosen activity in ways that enrich the making practice.

# Prototyping

![Bits and pieces for a hardware prototype.](img/2017-hardware-proto.jpg){width=50%}

## What is a prototype

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- _"primitive form"_
- the form that comes before... something.
- in this context: 
  - a _testable_ form
  - a form we can _experience_
- enables evaluation and iteration
- _primitive_: should be somehow rough or limited

manifestation of an idea [@design-thinking-bootleg:2018], e.g.:

- a wall of post-its
- a role-playing game
- an activity

## Why make prototypes

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

- empathy gaining
- exploration (build to think)
- testing
- inspiration
- learn
- solve disagreements
- start a conversation
- fail quickly and cheaply

## Kinds of Prototypes

- all of the above were used to _test_ ideas and drive evaluation
- some are more like a final product
- we use the word "fidelity" to mean how close a prototype is like a final product
- _low-fidelity:_ (low-fi) rough, quick, not like a final product
- _high-fidelity:_ (high-fi) more polished, slower to make, more like a final product

## Making Hardware Prototypes

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

- Build _working_ prototype systems in hardware
- [micro:bit](https://microbit.org) - cheap, small, with IO on the board (hello comp2300!)
- [arduino](https://arduino.cc), big ecosystem, not-as-good boards.
- [raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com), cheap way to get Linux into a prototype
- [Bela](https://bela.io) (charles' friends!), pricey but hard realtime OS is good for audio interactions.

::::::::::::::

## low- versus high-fidelity

| Type | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|---|
| low-fi | - quick revision<br>- multiple ideas<br>- good for communication<br>- good proof of concept | - limited error checking<br>- poor specification for dev<br>- facilitator driven<br>- usability not clear<br>- flow limitations |
| high-fi | - more functionality<br>- more interactive<br>- user driven<br>- exploration and test<br>- look and feel<br>- marketing/convincing | - hard work<br>- time consuming to fix<br>- inefficient for proof of concepts<br>- could be mistaken for a product<br>- could set poor expectations |

## Compromises

- compromise is inherent to prototyping
- make something quickly to test a particular aspect
- prototype must be built with the key issues in mind
<!-- - horizontal vs vertical prototyping -->
- robustness vs flexibility

## Digital Wireframe

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
[wireframes](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/wireframe) are visual plans for a user interface focussed on structure.

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
- [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)

Established part of UX design process. Can walk through details of an interactive system with stakeholders.

## p5.js or Processing

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Make interactive systems quickly with a "sketching in code" mindset.

- Processing is the original (Java-based)
- includes a [simple IDE](https://processing.org) and library system
- p5.js is a javascript port
- includes an [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org)

Fast, interactive, not good for "normal" web design.

## Hardware Prototyping

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Sketch in hardware.

- Arduino, Microbit, Bela
- soldering and circuit design
- 3D printing
- fun, frustrating
- can be expensive

Convincing to test with a "real" product, can be used in real-world experiences.

## Vibecode

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
GenAI is pretty good at making interactive websites!

- just ask chattie to build a prototype of your idea.
- fast, cheap
- possibly a bit broken (bad if you don't know how to fix)
- risks?

Not necessarily bad in HCI: can we vibe code _way more_ prototypes than we could afford to build?

Can we live-code a prototype before the end of this lecture?

# Sketching and Prototyping in your Assessment

- In your assessments, sketches and prototypes are differentiated by role in a design process.
  - **Sketches:** part of ideation process, quickly find lots of ideas.
  - **Prototypes:** lead to something _testable_, should articulate the interaction
- Highest-fidelity is not necessarily better! 
- Best prototypes demonstrate a design process and allow the important aspects of interaction to be evaluated.
- I want to see evidence (through your prototypes) of a considered design process.
- Different prototypes may be appropriate for different designs.
