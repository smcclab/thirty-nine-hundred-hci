## Announcements

- **Assignment updates**:
  - template repo will be available this afternoon I promise
  - class reps: I'll get invites out this afternoon I promise!
  - questions on the forum welcome, look in the "assignments" category.

Apology: I completely changed what I planned to do in this lecture. This will be more fun / relevant to the assignment.

## Plan for the class

- Sketch
- Prototype
- Make

## Making

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Last week I talked a bit about _identity_ in HCI.

The _maker_ identity is really relevant to me.

Making things to find out what, whether, how, and why.

Making as research methodology.

The framing this week around _sketches_ and _prototypes_ as different things with **rules** may not be something I agree with!

## What is a sketch?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- quick
- timely
- inexpensive
- disposable
- plentiful
- clear vocabulary
- distinct gesture
- minimal detail
- appropriate degree of refinement
- suggest and explore rather than confirm

## What should a sketch include?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

This is up to you, but it could have

- title
- annotations
- short description
- a drawing

## Activity: Sketching toolkit?

What's your sketching toolkit? How do you develop ideas?

- Discuss with someone for 2 minutes then we'll hear some answers.

I give you permission to buy expensive notebooks and pens for this course.

## Is a sketch a prototype?

No (apparently).

<!-- ## How to choose your Best Ideas

- High-Fidelity Prototype – Design Idea EXCEPTIONAL
- Design idea is original, creative, and interesting.
- Connection to design opportunities identified in project 2 is clear and compelling.
- Design could be seamlessly used in the chosen activity in ways that enrich the making practice. -->

# Prototyping

![Bits and pieces for a hardware prototype.](img/2017-hardware-proto.jpg){width=50%}

## What is a prototype

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- _"primitive form"_
- the form that comes before... something.
- in this context: 
  - a _testable_ form
  - a form we can _experience_
- enables evaluation and iteration
- _primitive_: should be somehow rough or limited

manifestation of an idea [@design-thinking-bootleg:2018], e.g.:

- a wall of post-its

## Kinds of Prototypes

- all of the above were used to _test_ ideas and drive evaluation
- some are more like a final product
- we use the word "fidelity" to mean how close a prototype is like a final product
- _low-fidelity:_ (low-fi) rough, quick, not like a final product
- _high-fidelity:_ (high-fi) more polished, slower to make, more like a final product

# Prototype Definitions and Analysis

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Filters:** emphasise some aspects of a design, omit others. [@lim-prototypes:2008], [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023 Box 12.2]

- **Data:** size, type, use, privacy, organisation
- **Functionality:** needs, features
- **Interactivity:** input, output, feedback
- **Spatial Structure:** arrangement of interface, intangible, tangible, 2D, 3D
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Manifestations:** an external representation of the design [@lim-prototypes:2008], [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023 Box 12.2]

## low- versus high-fidelity

| Type | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|---|
| low-fi | - quick revision<br>- multiple ideas<br>- good for communication<br>- good proof of concept | - limited error checking<br>- poor specification for dev<br>- facilitator driven<br>- usability not clear<br>- flow limitations |
| high-fi | - more functionality<br>- more interactive<br>- user driven<br>- exploration and test<br>- look and feel<br>- marketing/convincing | - hard work<br>- time consuming to fix<br>- inefficient for proof of concepts<br>- could be mistaken for a product<br>- could set poor expectations |

## Compromises

- compromise is inherent to prototyping
- make something quickly to test a particular aspect
- prototype must be built with the key issues in mind
<!-- - horizontal vs vertical prototyping -->
- robustness vs flexibility

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

[wireframes](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/wireframe) are visual plans for a user interface focussed on structure.

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
- [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)

Established part of UX design process. Can walk through details of an interactive system with stakeholders.

## p5.js or Processing

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Make interactive systems quickly with a "sketching in code" mindset.

- Processing is the original (Java-based)
- includes a [simple IDE](https://processing.org) and library system
- p5.js is a javascript port
- includes an [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org)

Fast, interactive, not good for "normal" web design.

## Hardware Prototyping

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

Sketch in hardware.

- Arduino, Microbit, Bela
- soldering and circuit design
- 3D printing
- fun, frustrating
- can be expensive

Convincing to test with a "real" product, can be used in real-world experiences.

## Web or Application Stack (of your choice)

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

Everybody has different skills and areas of interest. 

- where are you comfortable to experiment?
- where do you want to build experience?
- for Charles it's usually:
  - Python/Flask/Bootstrap
  - or iOS/iPadOS, libpd (for sound)

Need to be careful to focus on _prototyping_. What does a prototype _not need_?

## Vibe Coding

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

GenAI is pretty good at making interactive websites!

- just ask chattie to build a prototype of your idea.
- fast, cheap
- possibly a bit broken (bad if you don't know how to fix)
- risks?
- problems?
- affordances?

Not necessarily bad in HCI: can we vibe code _way more_ prototypes than we could afford to build?

## Sketching and Prototyping in your Assessment

- in your assessments, sketches and prototypes are differentiated by role in a design process.
  - **sketches:** part of ideation process, quickly find lots of ideas, explore the needs and solutions
  - **prototypes:** lead to something _testable_, should articulate an interaction

###  **Highest-fidelity is not necessarily better!**

- best prototypes demonstrate a design process
- allow the important aspects of interaction to be evaluated
- I want to see evidence (through your prototypes) of a considered design process
- different prototypes may be appropriate for different designs
