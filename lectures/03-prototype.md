## Announcements

- **Assignment updates**:
  - template repo is available
  - questions on the forum welcome, look in the "assignments" category.

Apology: I completely changed what I planned to do in this lecture. Last week sucked at ANU, I want to lecture things I like. I think you'll like it too.


## Plan for the class

- Sketch
- Prototype
- Make

## Making

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Last week I talked a bit about _identity_ in HCI.

My real identity here: _maker_. 

Making things to find out what, whether, how, and why.

Making as research methodology.

The framing this week around _sketches_ and _prototypes_ as different things with **rules** may not be something I agree with!

## Is a sketch a prototype?

No.

## How to Choose your Best Ideas

## Ten Principles of Good Design

![[Dieter Rams (Video and Webpage)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/good-design)](img/06_ideation_11.jpg)

## How to choose your Best Ideas

- High-Fidelity Prototype – Design Idea EXCEPTIONAL
- Design idea is original, creative, and interesting.
- Connection to design opportunities identified in project 2 is clear and compelling.
- Design could be seamlessly used in the chosen activity in ways that enrich the making practice.

Bill Buxton sez! So do it! [@buxton-sketching:2007]

## Activity: Sketch Demo

Let's sketch something.

# Prototyping

## Introduction

- Design, prototyping, construction - Design phase 
- Solutions are created, prototyped, tested, iterated
- Repeated design-evaluation-redesign cycles with users
- Two aspects to design - conceptual and concrete
- [@design-thinking-bootleg:2018]

## Prototyping - What

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Concrete manifestation of an idea
- Allows stakeholders to interact and explore
- Take many forms for different purposes
- 3D printing is commonly used now

## Prototyping – Why?

> Discussion question: Why do we prototype?

## Prototyping - Why

- Communication device
- Discuss/evaluate/explore ideas
- Important in many design disciplines
- Answer questions, help choose between alternatives
- Serve many purposes
- Product prototype versus service prototype [@saffer-designing:2010]
- Move on from bad ideas

## Prototyping - Example

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

- Paper-based prototype to help a child with autism to communicate
- Functions and buttons
- Positioning and labels
- Shape of the device
- No actual functionality

## Making Hardware Prototypes

- Build _working_ prototype systems in hardware
- [micro:bit](https://microbit.org) - cheap, small, with IO on the board (hello comp2300!)
- [arduino](https://arduino.cc), big ecosystem, not-as-good boards.
- [raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com), cheap way to get Linux into a prototype
- [Bela](https://bela.io) (charles' friends!), pricey but hard realtime OS is good for audio interactions.


## Makey Makey

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Alligator clip to connect switches / sensors
- Works as a keyboard
- e.g., [banana spacebar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU)

## Prototyping - High-Fidelity

- Looks and acts more like the final product
- Continuum between low and high fidelity
- answer design questions, learn about constraints
- Evolve through stages of fidelity
- design-evaluate-redesign cycles
- Modify/integrate existing components / tools / kits



## A High-fidelity prototype

![[What could this be?](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/lisa-windows-story-home-computers)](img/07_prototyping_34.jpg)

## Concrete Design

Visual appearance (colour, layout, graphics, fonts etc).
Interface types – design principles and guidelines
Interaction modalities including input and output
Accessibility and inclusivity

## Prototyping - Filters & Manifestations

![Sharp et al. Table 12.3 advantages and disadvantages of low- and high-fidelity prototypes](img/07_prototyping_38.png)


## Prototyping - Compromises

- Compromise is inherent to prototyping
- Make something quickly to test a particular aspect
- Prototype must be built with the key issues in mind
- Horizontal vs vertical prototyping
- Robustness vs changeability

## Prototyping Tools and Resources

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Crafting materials
- Digital wireframing and prototyping tools e.g. [Figma, Miro, Wireframe.cc](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/wireframing)
- Microsoft PowerPoint- a powerful prototyping tool!!
- Physical computing devices (e.g., Arduino, Makey Makey)
- Design patterns, open source resources, interaction design tools- See @rogers-beyond-hci:2023 Sections 13.3-13.5

## Conceptual Design

- Developing a Conceptual Model
- An outline of what people can do and what concepts are needed to understand how to interact
- Need to understand the problem space and users
- Generate ideas based on understanding
- Explore ideas with tutorial groups

## Conceptual Model

- Metaphor, analogies, concepts, relationships, mappings
- How to choose  __interface metaphors__ that will help users understand the product?
- Which  __interaction types__ would best support the users’ activities?
- Do different  __interface types__ suggest alternative design insights or options?

## Interface Metaphors

Choosing metaphors [@erickson-metaphors:1995]

1. Identify functional requirements (what it will do)
2. Which parts are likely to cause users problems?
3. Generate metaphors

Evaluate metaphors: Structure, Relevance, Representation, Understandable, Extensible (Sharp et al., p. 440-441 for example)

## Interaction Types

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
Instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring, responding

- Which is best, depends on the design
- Most models will include a combination
- Different parts will have different types
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](img/07_prototyping_40.png)

::::::::::::::

## Interface Types

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Prompt and support different user experiences / behaviour
- Prototyping will require an interface type or candidates
- Depends on product constraints from requirements
- Input and output modes <- user/context requirements

## Take away messages

- Prototyping can serve many purposes in HCI research, and support different stages of the design process
- There is more than one way to prototype a single design concept (low fi and hi fi)
- Prototypes help you  __to learn __ about your users’ interactions and experiences with your design artifact
- Your choice of prototyping approach depends on what you are trying to learn and why
