> cognition, n.

"The action or faculty of knowing taken in its widest sense, including sensation, perception, conception, etc., as distinguished from feeling and volition..."

## Cognitive processes

Cognitive processes can change depending on the problem:

- __Experiential Cognition__: 2 + 2 =
- __Reflective Cognition__: 21 x 19 =

## What are cognitive processes?

## 1. Attention

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Selecting things to focus on, relevant to our needs,  from possibilities.

- clear goals (directed searching vs browsing)
- information presentation (structure and layout in the interface)
- multitasking and attention
  - depends on individuals and context
  - relevance of distractions
  - effort to task switch
  - designing to support effective multitasking

::::::::::::::

## Design Implications for Attention

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- consider context to make information salient when required
- techniques: animation, colour, ordering, spacing
- avoid clutter
- support switching and returning

## 2. Perception

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- “[…] how information is acquired from the environment via the five sense organs (vision, hearing, taste, smell, and touch) and transformed into experiences of objects, events, senses, and tastes” (Roth, 1986 in @rogers-beyond-hci:2023 p. 109)
- Proprioception: Awareness of position and movement of body through muscles and joints
- Vision -> hearing -> touch (sighted individuals)

::::::::::::::

## Design Implications for Perception

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- design icons and graphics to be distinguished
- white space and separators to group information
- sounds (earcons!) can help distinguish information
- colour contrast is important for perception (and accessibility)
- haptic feedback: use carefully, perhaps in response to user initiated actions

## 3. Memory

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- brain filters what to remember and what to forget to avoid overload – but not always in the way we want to!
- filtering into memory – depends on encoding process (e.g., active vs passive learning) and context (e.g., seeing someone in a different context)
- people are better at recognition than recall
- relying on technology rather than memory (e.g., car navigation system, “let's ask Claude..”)
- personal information management
- remembering passwords and multifactor authentication

## Contextual Factors

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Think about the setting and context in which interaction takes place:

- Who, what, when, where, why, how of your activity
- How technology extends spatial and temporal dimensions
- What the explicit and unwritten rules, norms, conventions, practices are
- How people interact with tools, technologies, and their environment
- How the setting shape the activity and outputs – “situated actions and practices” [@suchman:1987]
