# Discovering Requirements

> “A statement about an intended product that specifies what it is expected to do and how it will perform” [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023, p.387]

- First two stages of the double diamond
- Discovered through “targeted activities” or “tangentially” through-out the design process
- Not static but EVOLVE during design
- There are many different types of requirements and ways of presenting and communicating requirements
- Want to avoid misunderstanding and miscommunication

## Interaction Design Processes

## Types of requirements

## User stories

- “Represents a unit of customer-visible functionality”
- “Starting point for a conversation to extend and clarify requirements”
- Functionality, user experience, usability goals

## Design Implications/Recommendations

## Bringing requirements to life: Personas

![Image [source](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html)](img/05_03_discovering_requirements_6.jpg)

- Rich descriptions of typical users
- Don’t describe specific people but realistic
- Describe goals, behaviours, activities, environment
- How would this person use this product?

## Personas: example

## Scenarios

Narrative that “describes human activities or tasks in a story that allows exploration and discussion of contexts, needs, and requirements” [@rogers-beyond-hci:2023, p.408].

## Journey Map

> “A journey map is a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal.” [@gibbons-journey-mapping-101]

Components:

- Actor
- Scenario/Expectations
- Journey Phases
