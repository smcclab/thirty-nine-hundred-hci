## Choosing Techniques

## Adapting for Different Participants

- data gathering should adapt to different participants
- **children:** think and react differently to adults, e.g., adapt scales to visual representations [@putnam-sus-children:2020]
- **people with disabilities:** caregivers might be involved to adapt interview questions
- **animals(!):** hard to interpret behaviour, need to design interfaces to work without hurting animals [@mancini-aci:2017]

## Gathering Data Remotely

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- expectations for remote data gathering changed completely during pandemic!
- can access participants in different countries, age groups, abilities, specific or expert users
- observation could be recorded and then analysed later
- best practices might include [@mastrianni-remote:2021]:
  - running pilot tests before conducting sessions
  - have backups in place in case of issues
  - informing participants of technical requierments
  - use respective questioning if issues with think-aloud.
