## Announcements

- Gitlab Template now available for final project
- Finalised the marking rubric for final project

## Plan for the class

## Lecture Ideation

- Go through ["Composing Interactions" by Marije Baalman](https://composinginteractions.art/#contents)?
- Relate to ANU/UiO Research on Expressive Interaction
- CHI resources on expression and creative interaction
- Creativity and Cognition
- NIME etc.

# Conceptualising Expressive Interactions

> on art, sound and technology that innovates scientific research.

<!-- A historic example: Charles yaps on creative/expressive interaction at the heart of technology advancement.  -->

- Much of questions concern with the mapping of performed gesture and resulting feedback. 

- Gestures:
    - The use of motions by the limbs or body as a means of expression.
    - Can be unintentional; ancillary gestures.
    - From non-human actors(e.g.,the movement of a leave on a branch of a tree.)
    - *"any sort of motion, that may be understood as an expression of something"*

The mapping from gestures to output media.

> Considering a performer performing making gestures on a stage, which gestures effect changes in the output medium of sound, which can be heard by the performer and audience in the real, physical environment.

E.g.,

- A gesture is performed inthe environment;
- This is captured by a sensor that translates the gesture is processed by an electronic circuit, often to digitalise it;
- Next, the signal enters some sort of computational model that translates the data to parameters;
- These parameters control an output medium such as sound, light, video, or mechatronics.

**Who has a question?**

- I can take _cathchbox_ question up until 2:55
- For after class questions: meet me outside the classroom at the bar (for 30 minutes)
- Feel free to ask about **any aspect of the course**
- Also feel free to ask about **any aspect of computing at ANU**! I may not be able to help, but I can listen.
