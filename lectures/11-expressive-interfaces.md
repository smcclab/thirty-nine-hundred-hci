## Announcements

- Gitlab Template now available for final project
- Finalised the marking rubric for final project

## Plan for the class

## Lecture Ideation

# Conceptualising Expressive Interactions

> on art, sound and technology that innovates scientific research.

<!-- A historic example: Charles yaps on creative/expressive interaction at the heart of technology advancement.  -->

- Much of questions concern with the mapping of performed gesture and resulting feedback. 

- Gestures:
    - The use of motions by the limbs or body as a means of expression.
    - Can be unintentional; ancillary gestures.
    - From non-human actors(e.g.,the movement of a leave on a branch of a tree.)
    - *"any sort of motion, that may be understood as an expression of something"*

The mapping from gestures to output media.

> Considering a performer performing making gestures on a stage, which gestures effect changes in the output medium of sound, which can be heard by the performer and audience in the real, physical environment.

## Conceptualising Expressive Interactions

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Steps in mapping:

- A gesture is performed in the environment;
- This is captured by a sensor that translates the gesture is processed by an electronic circuit, often to digitalise it;
- Next, the signal enters some sort of computational model that translates the data to parameters;
- These parameters control an output medium such as sound, light, video, or mechatronics.

> how is output from one connected to input, what happens in each step?

Charles discusses how this process relates to expressive interaction.

# Drawing Interaction

- [AirPens: Musical Doodling](
 https://nime2025.org/proceedings/166.html) [To Charles: this is installation, not bibtex. I know you may not like this example.]
    - Make music with mark-making.
    - Use IMU sensors to convert movement into sound; explore different mappings between movement and sound.

# Music Interaction

The [New Interface for Musical Expression (NIME)](https://nime.org) research community.

<!-- references -->
- Research into musical instrument design that explores how technological innovation can enable new musical expression, enhance performer control and intimacy, and shape the musician‚Äìinstrument relationship
- Digital instruments: digital piano, drum pad.
- Augmented instruments: magnetic resonator piano (grand piano -> string instruments).
- Novel instrument: lady's glove, magnetic AI instrument *thales*, percussive instrument [PhaseRings](https://charlesmartin.au/projects/phaserings/), AR instrument *cube*.

# Music Interaction

the mapping framework - expressivity and design constraints.

# Dance Interaction

From gestures to body (embodied) movements.

CO/DA System[@coda2022chi]:

![](img/coda-system.jpg){width="80%"}

- Support real-time manipulation of continuous streams of the dancers‚Äô motion data for interactive sound synthesis.
- Enable novel dance improvisations through live coding.
- Live coding: interactively programming musical or visual processes as performance.


# Dance Interaction

<!-- Novelty in terms of expressivity. -->
![](img/coda-process.jpg){width="60%"}

- Movements are measured using motion sensors, and the live coder processes motion signals to generate feedback in real-time.
- Enables a multitude of feedback loops: sound feedback -> movement improvisation -> the coder alters the relationships between movement and sound.
- Dynamic improvisation that stimulates novel movements' exploration.

[Dinosaur Choir: Adult Corythosaurus](https://nime2025.org/assets/preprints/nime2025_music_preprint_270.pdf)

- Singing dinosaur skull musical instruments.
- Aim to realise dinosaur vocalisation:  inspired by recent research to base dinosaur vocal anatomy on the bird syrinx, despite dinosaur vocal organs are still an actively debated question in paleontology.
- Use microphone to capture the voice by users, feeding into a computational vocal model and resonating the sound through a 3D printed replica of the dinosaur‚Äôs nasal cavities and skull.
- Change the pitch and timbre of the vocalisation by changing the shape of the mouths, like trumpet player.

# Playful Interaction

> Have you imagined a breath-controlled amusement rides?

- Inspired by robotic technologies for control of individual seats on rollercoasters and other thrill rides.

- How about using breath instead?

- Enhanced bucking bronco ride that balances realism for breadth control and practicability in cost, tourability and safety.

# Playful Interaction

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

- A straightforward mapping: the rider‚Äôs breathing to the horizontal rotation of the ride.
    - Inhale: spins clockwise; exhale: spins anti-clockwise.
    - Breathing speed controls rotation speed: fast breathing faster spin; holding breath stops spinning.
    - Difficulty levels.
- The program is a game in which the player scores more points the more that they breathe: a physical challenge vs reward dynamic.
    - More breathing for faster ride but harder to stay on. To score high, you must breathe more, but this makes the ride tougher.
- *Blast theory if Charles you want to talk about it.*

**Who has a question?**

- I can take _cathchbox_ question up until 2:55
- For after class questions: meet me outside the classroom at the bar (for 30 minutes)
- Feel free to ask about **any aspect of the course**
- Also feel free to ask about **any aspect of computing at ANU**! I may not be able to help, but I can listen.
