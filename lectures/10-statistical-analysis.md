## Lecture Ideation

What can this lecture be about?

- Lazar Chapter 4 Statistical Analysis (get up to _p_ and ANOVA properly)
- Python examples
- Put together a colab.google notebook to demo with fake data
- Put activities to collect some live in lectures (if enough people show up)

### Maybe not these things.

- conceptualising interaction (Interaction Design chapter 3 was missed?)
- data at scale ethical concerns (interaction design chapter 10)

## Plan for the class


## Statistics: t-tests

- Widely used in HCI to compare means between two conditions (e.g., menu selection times) and test if differences are statistically significant.
- Include the t-value, degrees of freedom (df), and p-value, where df depends on participant numbers, and p indicates the probability the result is due to chance.
- `p < 0.05` typically means the difference is significant, allowing rejection of the null hypothesis, with smaller p-values (e.g., <0.01) indicating stronger evidence.
