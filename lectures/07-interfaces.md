# Direct Manipulation and Immersive Environments

[@shneiderman-hci:2018, S7.1]

## What is Direct Manipulation?

1. Continuous representation of objects and actions with visual metaphors
2. Physical actions (i.e., buttons) instead of complex syntax
3. Rapid, incremental, reversible actions with immediate visibility

E.g., drawing with MS Paint vs typing [SVG commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorials/SVG_from_scratch/Basic_shapes):

`<path d="M20,230 Q40,205 50,230 T90,230" fill="none" stroke="blue" stroke-width="5"/>`

## Examples of Direct Manipulation

- Geographical systems (e.g., Google Maps)
- Video games
- Computer-aided design (CAD), and fabrication (e.g., 3D printing)

## 2D and 3D Interfaces

## Teleoperation and Presence

_Studied but less accepted before 2020!_

- telehealth
- robotic surgery
- telepresence robots
- teleconferencing (Zoom)
- virtual co-presence (e.g., Discord, v.s. Gather Town)

## Augmented and Virtual Reality

Interfaces can sit on a spectrum between fully virtual and fully real interaction [@milgram-mr:1994].

- The big middle area includes "mixed reality" (MR) interfaces
- Augmented reality usually closer to "real" reality.
- eXtended reality (XR) is a more recent term.

## Introduction to Interface Diversity

- Default solution for many developers: **smartphone apps** (millions on Apple & Google stores).  
- The **web** remains central for delivering services across many devices & browsers.  
- Interfaces extend beyond apps & web: **voice, touch, gesture, multimodal**.  
- **Input methods**: mouse, touchpad, pen, controllers, joysticks, RFID, gestures, brain‚Äìcomputer.  
- **Output methods**: GUIs, speech, AR/VR, tangible interfaces, wearables, holograms.  
- Goal: **overview of 22 interface types**‚Äîfrom command-based to holographic.

## Questions: Who has a question?

**Who has a question?**

- I can take _cathchbox_ question up until 2:55
- For after class questions: meet me outside the classroom at the bar (for 30 minutes)
- Feel free to ask about **any aspect of the course**
- Also feel free to ask about **any aspect of computing at ANU**! I may not be able to help, but I can listen.
