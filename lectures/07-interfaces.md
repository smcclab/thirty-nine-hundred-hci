# Direct Manipulation and Immersive Environments

[@shneiderman-hci:2018, S7.1]

## What is Direct Manipulation?

1. Continuous representation of objects and actions with visual metaphors
2. Physical actions (i.e., buttons) instead of complex syntax
3. Rapid, incremental, reversible actions with immediate visibility

E.g., drawing with MS Paint vs typing [SVG commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorials/SVG_from_scratch/Basic_shapes):

`<path d="M20,230 Q40,205 50,230 T90,230" fill="none" stroke="blue" stroke-width="5"/>`

## Examples of Direct Manipulation

- Geographical systems (e.g., Google Maps)
- Video games
- Computer-aided design (CAD), and fabrication (e.g., 3D printing)

## 2D and 3D Interfaces

## Teleoperation and Presence

_Studied but less accepted before 2020!_

- telehealth
- robotic surgery
- telepresence robots
- teleconferencing (Zoom)
- virtual co-presence (e.g., Discord, v.s. Gather Town)

## Augmented and Virtual Reality

Interfaces can sit on a spectrum between fully virtual and fully real interaction [@milgram-mr:1994].

- The big middle area includes "mixed reality" (MR) interfaces
- Augmented reality usually closer to "real" reality.
- eXtended reality (XR) is a more recent term.
