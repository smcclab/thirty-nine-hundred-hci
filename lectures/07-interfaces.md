## Announcements

## Plan for the class


- Overview of the diversity of interfaces.
- Outline key design and research considerations for each interface
- Discuss what is meant by a natural user interface
- Consider which interface is best for a given application or activity

# Interface Types

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
How would you describe a computer interface?

- graphical, command, speech, ambient, intelligent, tangible, touchless, or natural, etc.

Some interface types are primarily concerned with a function (for example, to be smart such as *smart* phones);

while others focus on the **interaction style** used (e.g., command, graphical or multimedia), 
the **input/output device** used (e.g., pen-based, speech-based, or gesture-based), 
or the **platform being designed** for (for example, tablet, mobile, PC, or wearable).

now with ML algorithms that are intended to recognise faces, objects, and the like ü§ñ!

## Interface Types ++
Let's talk about some main types of interfaces emerged over the past 45 years, loosely in time order.
 <!-- in terms of when they were developed. -->

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Command
- Graphical
- Multimedia
- Virtual reality
- Web
- Mobile
- Appliance
- Voice
- Pen
- Touch
- Touchless
:::
::: {.column width="50%" height="90%"}
- Haptic
- Multimodal
- Shareable
- Tangible
- Augmented reality
- Wearables
- Robots and drones
- Brain-computer
- Smart
- Shape-changing
- Holographic

::::::::::::::

## Command-Line Interfaces

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Type in abbreviated commands (e.g., `ls`),

pressing certain combinations of keys (e.g., `Ctrl + V`),

fixed from the keyboard (e.g., `delete`, `enter`, `esc`) or user defined.

These interfaces have been largely superseded by graphical interfaces such as menus, icons, keyboard shortcuts and pop-up/predictable text commands as part of an application. 

- Though they continue to be useful in using complex software package (e.g., CAD), scripting batch operations, website, and hacking.

# Direct Manipulation and Immersive Environments

[@shneiderman-hci:2018, S7.1]

## What is Direct Manipulation?

1. Continuous representation of objects and actions with visual metaphors
2. Physical actions (i.e., buttons) instead of complex syntax
3. Rapid, incremental, reversible actions with immediate visibility

E.g., drawing with MS Paint vs typing [SVG commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorials/SVG_from_scratch/Basic_shapes):

`<path d="M20,230 Q40,205 50,230 T90,230" fill="none" stroke="blue" stroke-width="5"/>`

## Examples of Direct Manipulation

- Geographical systems (e.g., Google Maps)
- Video games
- Computer-aided design (CAD), and fabrication (e.g., 3D printing)

## 2D and 3D Interfaces

## Teleoperation and Presence

_Studied but less accepted before 2020!_

- telehealth
- robotic surgery
- telepresence robots
- teleconferencing (Zoom)
- virtual co-presence (e.g., Discord, v.s. Gather Town)

## Augmented and Virtual Reality

Interfaces can sit on a spectrum between fully virtual and fully real interaction [@milgram-mr:1994].

- The big middle area includes "mixed reality" (MR) interfaces
- Augmented reality usually closer to "real" reality.
- eXtended reality (XR) is a more recent term.

## Introduction to Interface Diversity

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Default solution for many developers: **smartphone apps** (millions on Apple & Google stores).  
- The **web** remains central for delivering services across many devices & browsers.  
- Interfaces extend beyond apps & web: **voice, touch, gesture, multimodal**.  
- **Input methods**: mouse, touchpad, pen, controllers, joysticks, RFID, gestures, brain‚Äìcomputer.  
- **Output methods**: GUIs, speech, AR/VR, tangible interfaces, wearables, holograms.  
- Goal: **overview of 22 interface types**‚Äîfrom command-based to holographic.

## Questions: Who has a question?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Who has a question?**

- I can take _cathchbox_ question up until 2:55
- For after class questions: meet me outside the classroom at the bar (for 30 minutes)
- Feel free to ask about **any aspect of the course**
- Also feel free to ask about **any aspect of computing at ANU**! I may not be able to help, but I can listen.
