## What is Human Computer Interaction

Research that:

- considers how humans can and do use computers
- proposes computer systems (incl. software) that can be better used by humans
- uncovers the needs of different kinds of computer users
- works out how people can participate in designing computer systems
- understands the roles of computer systems in society, politics, social movements and beyond.

## Interdisciplinary Research

All HCI research is interdisciplinary:

- Computer Science
- Engineering
- Human Factors / Ergonomics
- Cognitive Science / Psychology
- Social Science
- Design

## A brief history of HCI...

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Starting with **ergonomics & human factors**.

- 20th Century: Humans started to operate complex machines
- Post 1945: engineering focus on operator’s cognition, response, decisions, perceptions, etc
- Ergonomics or human factors coined in 1950s to describe the human requirements for designing machines and systems.

## HCI history: The computer

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Computing in the 1950s-70s meant mainframes and batch processing—normal people didn’t use computers!
- 1968: Douglas Engelbart introduced prototype concepts for interactive computing as we know it:
  - Mouse
  - GUI
  - Collaboration 
- Called the “mother of all demos”: <https://youtu.be/yJDv-zdhzMY>

## HCI history: The start of "users"

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- ~1980s: big interest in using  computers in workplaces and homes
- Demand for computers to work for normal people (not just trained operators)
- 1983: first annual ACM [SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org) Conference (Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction)

Now:

- SIGCHI publishes [~5000 publications per year](https://medium.com/sigchi/sigchi-annual-report-a147d5f98eeb) (more than 2x any other ACM SIG) across 26 conferences including _CHI_ (the big one).

## HCI history: The "wave" theory

- First wave: Human Factors in Computing (1980-1992)
  - Optimising/measuring efficiency, cognitive psychology approach, studying individual users. Lab setting.
- Second wave: Cognitive revolution — mind and computer coupled (1992-2006)
  - Optimise interactions, hypothesis testing, affordances, activity theory, user-centred design. Work environments.
- Third wave: Situated perspectives ([Bødker 2015](https://doi.org/10.1145/2804405)) (2006-)
  - Consumer tech, participation and sharing, pervasive computing, AR, tangible interaction, home environments,
- Fourth wave: Entanglement HCI ([Frauenberger 2019](https://doi.org/10.1145/3364998)) (2019-)
  - Computer and humans entangled in society: focus on values, accessibility, diversity, policy, law, ethics, individuals’ and society’s responsibilities

## What does HCI research involve?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Understanding how computers are used in society.
- Working with people to understand how they use computers.
- Designing new human-computer interfaces (applications).
- Working with people (users) to design and evaluate the above.
