- assignment 2 specification will be published soon, [you can see the "main idea" already on Canvas](https://canvas.anu.edu.au/courses/2781/assignments/11550)
- keep attending labs, if issues, apply for an [extension (see course policies on Canvas)](https://canvas.anu.edu.au/courses/2781/pages/policies)
- any questions, problems, [**use the forum**](https://edstem.org/au/courses/24905/discussion)!
- lab marks come out weekly via Canvas

## Plan for the class

- Overview of analysis, interpretation, presentation
- Quantitative Analysis (demos!)
- Qualitative Analysis (demos!)
- Analytical Frameworks
- Interpreting and Presenting Findings

# Analysis, Interpretation, Presentation

- last week we talked about getting data
- once we have it, what can we do with it?
- quantitative approaches
- qualitative approaches
- or a combination (common in HCI!)

## Processes

- (data gathering)
- data cleaning
    - e.g., `age = 999`
- analysis and interpretation
    - different tasks, but often parallel
- presentation

## Bias in Analysis and Interpretation

- **bias:** influence affecting objective judgement and decision making
- integrating new data with past experience (**bias is normal!**)
- **conscious:** we know about them and their effect on us
- **unconscious:** subtle effects that we don't know about

## Specific Biases

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- **familiarity bias:** do what we know best
    - ignore unfamiliar methods
    - ignore unfamiliar data sources
- **self-attribution bias:** giving ourselves too much credit
    - falsely attribute improvements to our design and not external factors, user learning, etc
    - overlook alternative explanations
- **confirmation bias:** discarding information that contradicts existing belief
    - more on [confirmation bias](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/confirmation-bias-ux/)
    - ignore non-supporting evidence
    - analyse for confirmation, not for discovery
    - overlook alternative analyses and sources

## Quantitative and Qualitative

- typical categorisation of data
- **Quantitative data:** form of numbers or easily translated into numbers
    - years experience
    - number of minutes to perform a task
- **Qualitative data:** words, images, sound
    - descriptions
    - interview transcripts
    - photos
- Some data can be represented as both
    - e.g., digital text, sound, images can be represented and analysed numerically (is this useful?)

## Quantitative and Qualitative Methods

**Quantitative Analysis:** find magnitude, amounts or size of _something_ and make rigorous comparisons

**Qualitative Analysis:** find the nature of things, themes, patterns, stories

## Use and Misuse of Numbers

- It's easy to misuse numerical data and the results of analyses
- This can particularly happen when transforming the type of data (e.g., agreement ratings to a numerical code)

### Some example problems

- "50% of users took longer than 30 minutes" vs "2 out of 4 users..."
- The mean agreement was 3.67

## First Steps

- Interviews: transcribe (e.g., using [Aiko](https://sindresorhus.com/aiko)), expand notes, enter closed questions into spreadsheets (treated as quantitative)
- Questionnaires: enter into spreadsheets, clean up data, filter into datasets
- Observations: expand notes, transcribe recordings, edit videos, synchronise and clean up interaction data

# Basic Quantitative Analysis

![What do we do with quantitative data once we have some?]()

## Centre of a set of data

_what's the average_ of a set of values?

- **Mean:** sum of the values divided by the number of entries.
- **Median:** order the set numerically and find the value in the middle (or if even number of entries, halfway between the two middle entries)
- **Mode:** the most common entry

Example: `[2, 2, 3, 4, 873]`

## Questions: Who has a question?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Who has a question?**

- I can take _cathchbox_ question up until 2:55
- For after class questions: meet me outside the classroom at the bar (for 30 minutes)
- Feel free to ask about **any aspect of the course**
- Also feel free to ask about **any aspect of computing at ANU**! I may not be able to help, but I can listen.
